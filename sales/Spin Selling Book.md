# Chapter 1In summary, the traditional selling models, mjethods, and tech- niques that most of us have been trained to use work best in small sales. For now, let me define small as a sale which can normally be completed in a single call and which involves a low dollar value. Un- fortunately, these tried-and-true low-value sales techniques—most of them dating from the 1920s—don't work today in complex high- value sales. The problem with these techniques isn't ithat they are out- dated; people wouldn't still be using them after 60 years unless they had something valid to offer. Their inadequacy, and my reason for this book, is that these techniques work effectively only in very simple low-value sales.

# What is a large sale and low-value sale?

## Length of Sales Cycle
Whereas a simple low-value sale can often be completed in one call, a major sale may require many calls spread over a period of months.

## Size of Customer's Commitment
Almost by definition, large purchases involve bigger decisions from the customer, and this alters the psychology of the sale. In a small sale the customer is less conscious of value. As the size of the sale increases, suc- cessful salespeople must build up the perceived value of their products or services. The building of perceived value is probably the single most important selling skill in larger sales. 

## The Ongoing Relationship
Most large sales involve an ongoing relationship with the customer. Partly, this is because major purchases usually require some post-sale support—which means that the buyer and seller must meet one or more times after the sale. Also, the people selling major g oods or services usu- ally generate most of their business from developing their existing cus- tomers. In contrast, a smaller sale may often be a one-off event where the buyer will never meet the seller again.

In a small sale it's relatively easy to separate the seller from the product. Although I hated the projector seller, I liked his product enough to buy it. But with the larger decision, seller and product be- come much harder to separate. Although I liked the computer system, there was no way I could buy it without also buying a relationship with the seller. Because large decisions usually entail an ongoing involve- ment with the customer, they demand a different selling style. Later chapters will analyze what this difference is and how to use it to build lasting customer relationships.

## The Risk of Mistakes
In a small sale, customers can afford to take more risks because the con- sequences of mistakes are relatively small. But it's different with a bigger decision. If I buy the wrong car, I can't put it on a shelf where my wife won't notice it. When I'm looking for a new computer, at least 10 people in my company play some part in the decision, and everybody will use it once it's installed. So if the computer doesn't work, then my whole company knows I made a bad choice. Larger decisions are more public and a bad decision is much more vis- ible.

## The Four Stages of a Sales Call
Major sales are significantly different from smaller sales in terms of cus- tomer psychology.  However, one of the simplest models of a sales call does seem to be ap- plicable to any size of sale; almost every sales call you can think of, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, goes through four distinct stages (Figure 1.1):

1. Preliminaries. These are the warming-up events that occur be- fore the serious selling begins. They include such things as the way you introduce yourself and how you begin the conversation. Some people believe that the Preliminaries are much more important than the word suggests.
2. 2. Investigating. Almost every sale involves finding something out by asking questions. You may be uncovering needs or getting a better understanding of your customers and their organizations. As we'll see, this is much more than the simple collection of data.  *Investigating is the most important of all selling skills, and it's particularly crucial in larger sales.* 
3. Demonstrating Capability. In most calls you will need to demon- strate to customers that you've something worthwhile to offer. Most of us in larger sales are selling solutions to customer problems. In the Demonstrating Capability stage of the call, you have to show customers that you have a solution and that it makes a worthwhile contribution to helping solve their problems. 
4. 4. Obtaining Commitment. Finally, a successful sales call will end with some sort of commitment from the customer. In smaller sales the commitment is usually in the form of a purchase, but in larger sales there may be a whole range of other commitments you have to obtain before you reach the order stage. Your call objective may, for example, be to get the customer's agreement to attend a product demonstration, or to test a new material, or to give you access to a higher level of deci- sion maker, and in none of these cases is the commitment an order.

*Sometimes the Investigating stage can take up almost the whole call. In selling consulting services, for example, you would! have to find out a great deal about the customer's needs before you! could determine whether there would be a basis for a business relationship.*

P.13

### The Investigating StageSuccess in the larger sale depends, more than anything else, on how the Investigating stage of the call is handled. We've collected data on Inves- tigating skills from massive studies involving many thousands of sales calls.

### Questions and Success
There is a clear statistical association between the use of ques-tions and the success of the interaction. The more you ask questions, the more successful the interaction is likely to be. And sjome types of ques- tions are more powerful than others.
* Open questions are particularly important to success in the larger sale, although closed questions can be successful if he sale is small,

We carried out several studies and were astonished :o find that there is no measurable relationship between the use of open questions and success. 

### A New Direction
We decided that the focus of our research would be to develop new and positive questioning models that could replace the old ones, which were proving so unsatisfactory. From watching sales calls, it was clear that successful people didn't just ask random questions. There was a distinct pattern in the successful call. In summary, the SPIN sequence of questions is:

*Situation Questions.* At the start of the call, successful people tend to ask data-gathering questions about facts and background. Typical Situation Questions would be "How long have yoik had your present equipment?" or "Could you tell me about your company's growth p l a n s ? " A l t h o u g h S i t u a t i o n Q u e s t i o n s h a v e aiji i m p o r t a n t f a c t - finding role, successful people don't overuse them because too many can bore or irritate the buyer.
*Problem Questions.* Once sufficient information has been estab- lished about the buyer's situation, successful peop e tend to move to a second type of question. They ask, for example,] "Is this operation difficult to perform?" or "Are you worried about the quality you get from your old machine?" Questions like these, which we call Prob- lem Questions, explore problems, difficulties, and! dissatisfactions in areas where the seller's product can help. Inexperienced people gen- erally don't ask enough Problem Questions.

*Implication Questions.* In smaller sales, sellers can be very success- ful if they just know how to ask good Situation and Problem Ques- tions. In larger sales this is not enough; successful people need to ask a third type of question. This third type is more coijnplex and sophis- ticated. It's called an Implication Question, andItypical examples would be "How will this problem affect your future! profitability?" or "What effect does this reject rate have on customer satisfaction?" Im- plication Questions take a customer problem and explore its effects or consequences. As we'll see, by asking Implication Questions successful people help the customer understand a problem's seriousness or urgency. Implication Questions are particularly important in large sales, and even very experienced salespeople! rarely ask them well. We'll be giving a lot of attention to Implication! Questions in this book.
*Need-payoff Questions.* Finally, we found that very, successful sales- people ask a fourth type of question during the Investigating stage. It's called a Need-payoff Question, and typical examples would be "Would it be useful to speed this operation by 10 percent?" or "If we could improve the quality of this operation, how jwould that help you?" Need-payoff Questions have several uses, as we'll see in Chap- ter 4. For now, perhaps the most important one is that they get the customer to tell you the benefits that your solution could offer. Need-payoff Questions have a very strong relationship to sales suc- cess. It's been common, in our studies, to find that] top performers ask more than 10 times as many Need-payoff Questions per call as do average performers.

The SPIN Model: These four types of questions—Situation, Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff—form a powerful questioning sequence that successful people use during the all-important Investigating stage of the call. I must emphasize that it's not a rigid sequence. Top people don't ask all their Situation Questions before moving on to Problem Questions, for example. But it would generally be true that Situation Questions are mosdy asked early in the call and that the other questions broadly follow in the S-P-I-N sequence.


# Chapter 2: Obtaining Commitment: Closing the Sale
*The Huthwaite research shows that success in the major sale depends, more than anything else, on how the Investigating stage of the call is handled. But not everybody would agree with this conclusion. For many writers, Obtaining Commitment is the most important step of a success- ful sale.* 

### What is closing?
A behavior used by the seller which implies or invites a commitment, sothat the buyer's next statement accepts or denies commitment.

* Assumptive closes. Assuming that the sale has already been made, one asks, for example, "Where would you like it delivered?" before the customer has agreed to buy.* Alternative closes. One asks, for example, "Would you prefer deliv- ery on Tuesday or Thursday?"—again before the customer has made a purchasing decision.* Standing-room-only closes. One says, for example, "If you can't make a decision right now, I'll have to offer it to another customer who's pressing to buy it."* Last-chance closes. One says, for example, "The price goes up next week, so unless you buy now,..."* Order-blank closes. One fills in the customer's answers on an order form, even though the buyer has not indicated a willingness to make a buying decision.

*I look back on my enthusiasm for closing with redl embarrassment. From what I now know about success in the larger sale, I see closing techniques as both ineffective and dangerous.* I've ejvidence that they lose much more business than they gain. What made me turn against methods that seemed so important to my own success? The rest of this chapter describes the series of studies that finally convinced me that tra- ditional closing techniques have no place in larger saljes.

P.25

After the training, we went out with the sellers again, this time to find out whether their use of closing had increased and what effect this had had on the results of their calls. Once again, closing turned out to be negatively related to success. After the training, the sellers used more closing techniques-^-so in one sense the training was effective. However, because fewer of the calls succeeded, the overall effect of the training was a decrease in sales (Figure 2.3).

The more I thought about this idea, the more I liked it. There were very good theoretical reasons for believing that this might be true. Clos- ing is a method of putting pressure on the customer. And psychologists now understand quite a lot about the impact of pressure on making de- cisions. Put very simply, the psychological effect of pressure seems to be this. If I'm asking you to make a very small decision, then—if I pressure you—it's easier for you to say yes than to have an argument. Conse- quently, with a small decision, the effect of pressure is positive. But this isn't so with large decisions. The bigger the decision, the more nega- tively people generally react to pressure

If my theory was correct, then the larger the decision, the less effec- tive the closing techniques were likely to be. But how could we test this? Was there a way to set up an experiment to test the effectiveness of clos- ing as the size of the decision grew larger? I didn't want to set up arti- ficial laboratory experiments, yet I didn't know how to validate the idea in any other way. Then one day we were presented with the perfect op- portunity on a plate.

1. Transaction time. How long did each sale or attempted sale take? 
2. Number of closes. How often did the seller use a closing behaviorduring the transaction?3. Percentage sale. What percentage of the transactions resulted in a purchase?

### Closing and price, low-value goods
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-29%20at%2010.50.37.png)

### Closing and price, high-value goods
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-29%20at%2010.51.17.png)

However, the figure that interested us was the success rate after training. We found that the program in closing, which had increased the success with cheap goods, had reduced the success with more expensive goods from 42 percent down to 33 percent.

## Two ConclusionsHow should we interpret these results? The first finding is that, with both high- and low-value goods, the average transaction time is reduced as the number of closes is increased. So we can draw the conclusion:

1. By forcing the customer into a decision, closing techniques speed the sales transaction.
2. Closing techniques may increase the chances of making a sale with low- priced products. With expensive products or services, they reduce the chances of making a sale.

## Closing techniques, like all forms of pressure, become less effective as decision size increases.
Nobody knows better than I do that this type of questionnaire data isn't a very reliable guide to actual behavior. But despitej all the limitations of this kind of evidence, closing techniques certainly don't seem to be fa- vorites with professional buyers.

As shown in Figure 2.6, the sellers who had been trained in closing had lower satisfaction ratings on both questions. What does this mean? The most likely interpretation is that, in using closing techniques, the sellers put pressure on customers to make a decision. Most people are less satisfied with decisions that they feel they've been pressured to make than with those which they believe they've made entirely of their own free will. This suggests that there's even more reason to be cautious about the use of closing techniques in larger sales, where the customer's post-sale sat- isfaction may be an important factor in future selling success.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-29%20at%2011.00.19.png)

Many sales managers have groaned inwardly as they've listened to their less experienced people reach the Obtaining Commitment stage of the call and then fail to close. They've heard something like this:NEW SELLER: SO, is there anything else I can tell you about this product? CUSTOMER: NO thanks. I think you've answered all my questions.NEW SELLER: Good. Good. You're sure there's nothing else I haven't covered?CUSTOMER: Not that I can think of.NEW SELLER: OK (horrid pause) uh... perhaps I didn't mention that it's gotdual voltage.CUSTOMER: Yes. Well I'm overdue for another meeting and...NEW SELLER: (with some desperation) It's also got an instruction manual inSpanish... if you need Spanish.CUSTOMER: Look, Mr. Newman, I've got to go.NEW SELLER: Um. Are you sure I've answered all your questions?

*What's wrong here? An inexperienced salesperson is afraid to bring the call to a conclusion and, as a result, the customer is getting impatient.*

This certainly happens in real life—and it's often noticeable in the selling of professional services. We've worked with First National Bank of Chicago, using Huthwaite's models to train calling officers. David Zehren of First Chicago, while agreeing with us that closing techniques are generally overused in major industrial sales, points out that in bank- ing there's often the opposite problem. "We haven't had a problem with excessive use of closing techniques," he explains. "If anything, we feel it necessary to lean in the other direction. Customers expect it. They get irritated by calls that don't have a clear understanding of what comes next."

The success rate in calls with no closing whatsoever was only 22 per- cent, compared with a 61 percent success rate in one-close calls (Figure 2.7). Notice, however, that the least successful calls were those with more than two closing behaviors, where the success rate was below 20 percent. So it seems that, despite all the disadvantages of closing tech- niques, calls with no closing whatsoever are unlikely to be effective.## Where Do We Go from Here?
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-29%20at%2011.19.09.png)

Everything I've written so far in this chapter is about how not to ob- tain commitment. I've said that traditional closing techniques are inef- fective or have a negative effect when:
• The sale is large, involving high-value goods.• The customer is sophisticated: for example, a professional buyer. 
• There is a continuing post-sale relationship with the customer.
* All that I've said suggests that closing techniques are not the best way to obtain commitment from the customer in a mkjor sale. But what should you do? As we've seen, doing nothing isn't effective either. The sale doesn't close itself.
## Obtaining the Right Commitment
The first step in successful closing is to set the right objectives. The starting point for obtaining a commitment is to know what level of commitment from the customer will be needed to make the call a success.
So, closing in a simple sale can have one of two outcomes—an Order, where you take the business, or a No-sale, where the customer turns you down. But as the sale becomes larger, it's not so straightforward. In major sales, relatively few calls result in an Order or a-j No-sale. Earlier I mentioned the case of a friend in the aircraft industry who went for 3 whole years without taking an order. At the same time, he didn't have any outright refusals that could be called No-sales. All his calls were somewhere in between. They made slow but modest progress toward his ultimate goal—an order in several years' time.

In most major-account sales forces, fewer than 10 percent of calls re- sult in an Order or No-sale. In these larger sales it becomes more diffi- cult to judge whether a call has been closed successfully. For example, suppose you're selling me a computer software package to help me with my inventory control. At the end of the call, I say to you, "Look, I'm convinced that your inventory system is what we need; But I can't make such an important decision alone, so I'd like to fix for you to come back next week and talk to our production controller." It's clear that the call has achieved something, yet it hasn't resulted in either an Order or a No-sale. It's somewhere in between. *However, because it's brought about another meeting, perhaps we could say that the call has been suc- cessfully closed.*

## Defining Closing Success in Larger Sales
So what's the test of closing success? What's the result, or outcome, that allows us to say that one call has been successful while another has failed?
The method we finally chose involved dividing the possible outcomes of the call into four areas (Figure 2.8):

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-29%20at%2011.26.00.png)

* *Order:* Where the customer makes a firm commitment to buy.
* *Advances:* Where an event takes place, either in the call or after it, that moves the sale forward toward a decision:  (In larger sales the most common objective of closing would normally be to obtain an Advance. Successful closing in the major sale starts by know- ing what Advance you can realistically obtain from the call.=
	* A customer's agreement to attend an off-site demonstration	• A clearance that will get you in front of a higher level of decision maker	• An agreement to run a trial or test of your product	• Access to parts of the account that were previously inaccessible to you
* *Continuations:* Where the sale will continue but where no specific action has been agreed upon by the customer to move it forward. These calls don't result in an agreed action, yet neither do they involve a "No" from the customer. Typical examples would be calls that end with a customer saying:
	* "Thank you for coming. Why don't you visit us again the next time you're in the area."
	* "Fantastic presentation, we're very impressed. Let's meet again some time."
	* "We liked what we saw and we'll be in touch if we need to take things further."
* *No-sales:* Our final category is where the customer actively refuses a commitment. At an extreme, the No-sale customer makes it clear that there's no possibility of any business.	

*Our studies of top salespeople consistently showed that they had a clear understanding of these different outcomes and that they used this understanding to help them close calls more effectively by turning Continuations into Advances. Top people set the kind of realistic closing objectives that moved major sales forward.* 

Let me illustrate this by contrasting the performance of two salespeople, each selling industrial pumping equipment. First, let's look at John C. He's relatively inexperienced, having spent only a year in major sales.

INTERVIEWER: What were your objectives for this call?JOHN c: Oh,...to make a good impression on the customer.INTERVIEWER: "Good impression"?
JOHN c: Well, yes, making the customer feel positive about us.
JOHN c: Well, yes, making the customer feel positive about us. INTERVIEWER: And any other objective?JOHN c: To collect data.INTERVIEWER: Data? What kind of data?JOHN c: Oh, useful facts. Stuff about the account. Just general informa- tion.INTERVIEWER: And were you trying to get a specific action from the cus- tomer?JOHN c: No. Like I say, it was mostly building a relationship and finding facts.INTERVIEWER; In your judgment, how successful was the call?JOHN c: Quite successful, I think.INTERVIEWER: Why do you say that?JOHN c: Well, for example, the customer said he was impressed by my pre-sentation.INTERVIEWER: Did the customer agree to any actions as a result of the call? JOHN c: Uh,...no- But I think he liked my presentation.INTERVIEWER: SO what will happen next with this customer?JOHN c : We'll meet again in a couple of months and then we'll take thingsfurther.INTERVIEWER: But* looking back on the call you just made, the customerdidn't agree to an action that moved the sale forward?JOHN c : No. But I'm sure the call contributed to building a good relation-ship with the account. That's why I think it was a successful call.

*John C.'s reaction is typical of inexperienced sellers. He thinks he's closed the call successfully because he received some positive strokes from the customer. But, turning to our definitions of call outcomes, his call has resulted in a Continuation.* There's been no specific action agreed upon by the customer that progresses the sale. Like many new salespeople, John's call objectives—collect data and build a relation- ship—don't directly contribute to getting an Advance.

In contrast, let's hear Fred F., one of the company's top salespeople, talking about his approach to a typical call:

INTERVIEWER: What were your call objectives?FRED F.: I wanted to get some movement because I knew we'd meet competitive pressure and I didn't want to let the grass grow under my feet. INTERVIEWER: Movement?
FRED F.: Yes. You see, I feel that if a call's worth making, it's got to do some- thing—to push the sale forward in some way. Otherwise, you're wasting both your time and the customer's.INTERVIEWER: Could you give me an example of a call objective that shows this "movement"?FRED F.: Sure. In this case what I wanted was to get their chief engineer to come to our factory for a feasibility discussion with our technical people. Now that takes the sale a step forward—and it would also mean that while he was talking with us he wouldn't be spending time with the com- petition.INTERVIEWER: And was the call successful?FRED F.: Yes and no. I didn't get their chief engineer because of some in-ternal issues. So in that sense I failed. But during the call I saw a chance to go forward in another area. The customer told me that they've just gotten the go-ahead to build a new plant in Jersey. They're setting up a project team to write specifications and choose suppliers. So I asked him if he'd call the team's hydraulics engineer and fix a meeting for me.INTERVIEWER: And he did?FRED F.: Yes, we meet on the 23d.INTERVIEWER: And that moves you forward?FRED F.: Of course. It puts me in on the ground floor. On the 23d I'll try toget their hydraulics guy to specify us as a supplier both for pumps and specialist pipework.*Notice how Fred F.'s objectives were about getting an action, or Ad- vance, and that he judged the call's success in terms of the movement it produced. It's this action-oriented approach that characterized the successful people we studied. They wanted Advances, not Continuations.* People who consistently aim for Advances rather than Continuations are often described by their managers as "good closers." In fact, their success comes from how they set call objectives rather than from how they close. 

# I’m often asked by sales managers for advice on how they should coach their people to close more successfully in major sales. The simplest and most effective advice I can offer is this: Teach your people the difference between Continuations and Advances, and help them be- come dissatisfied with setting call objectives that result only in a Continuation.

## Setting Call Objectives
In your call planning, always include objectives that result in specific action from the customer—objectives like "To get her to come to a dem- onstration," "To get a meeting with his boss," or "To get an introduc- tion to the Planning Department." In this way you'll be planning like the top salespeople in our study. You'll be looking for Advances, not for Continuations.

## Obtaining Commitment: Four Successful Actions

1. *Giving attention to Investigating and Demonstrating Capability.* Successful salespeople give their primary attention to the Investigating and Demonstrating Capability stages. 

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2014.31.03.png)

You won't obtain commitment in a major sale unless the customer clearly perceives a need for what you offer. The most effective people we observed were the ones who did an outstanding job of building needs during the Investigating stage. As a result of the questions they asked, their customers came to realize that they had an urgent need to buy.

* *Checking that key concerns are covered.* In larger sales, both the product and the customer's needs are likely to be relatively complex. As a result, there may well be areas of confusion or doubt in the customer's mind as the point of commitment nears.  We found that sellers who were most effective in obtaining commitment from their customers would invariably take the initiative and ask the buyer whether, there were any further points or concerns that needed to be addressed.

SELLER: (checking that all key concerns are covered) Well, I think that covers everything, Ms. Brown. But before we go further, could I check whether there are any areas that you feel I should tell you more about?
BUYER: Yes, you haven't mentioned the terms of the leasing arrangement.SELLER: Then let me cover that now. The way it works is...* *Summarizing the Benefits.* In a larger sale the call may have taken several hours and covered a wide range of topics. It's unlikely that the customer has a clear picture of everything that has been discussed. Successful salespeople pull the threads together by summarizing key points of the discussion before moving to the commitment. 

* *Proposing a commitment.* But it's here, at the point of commitment, that successful sellers don't ask—they tell. The most natural, and most effective, way to bring a call to a successful con- clusion is to suggest an appropriate next step to the customer.

SELLER: (checking key concerns) Is there anything else that we need to cover?BUYER: N O , I think we've discussed everything.SELLER: (summarising the benefits) Yes, we've certainly seen how the newsystem will speed your order processing and how it will be simpler to use than your present one. We've also discussed the way in which it can help you control costs. In fact, there seem to be some impressive benefits from changing, particularly as a new system would get rid of those reliability problems which have been worrying you.BUYER: Yes, when you add it all up, there's a lot of value to us from making the change.SELLER: (proposing a commitment) Then I might suggest that the most log- ical next step would be for you and your accountant to come and see one of these systems in operation.

*How do you know which commitment to propose?*
1. The commitment advances the sale. As a result of the commitment, the sale will move forward in some way.2. The commitment proposed is the highest realistic commitment that the customer is able to give. Successful sellers never push the customer beyond achievable limits.

# Chapter 3: Customer Needs in the Major Sale
In our research we consistently found that the people who were most effective during the Investigating stage were the ones most likely to be top sales performers.

### In contrast, the first time I bought a computer system there was up- wards of a year between initial discussions about our needs and the final decision. It's in the nature of major sales that needs aren't instant. They develop slowly and sometimes painfully. Major sales require special sell- ing skills to help this process of needs development—and these skills represent some of (he most crucial differences between success in small sales and in large.

The emotional component of needs does exist in larger sales, but it's more subtle and more subdued.

A $15 purchase is, of course, tiny even in terms of small sales. But it illustrates some key differences between needs in small sales and in large. Broadly speaking, we can say that as the sale becomes larger:• Needs take longer to develop.• Needs are likely to involve elements, influences, and inputs from several people, not just the wishes of a single individual.• Needs are more likely to be expressed on a rational basis, and even if the customer's underlying motivation is emotional or irrational, the need will usually require a rational justification.• A purchasing decision that doesn't adequately meet needs is likely to have more serious consequences for the decision maker.

## Any statement made by the buyer which expresses a want or concern that can be satisfied by the seller.

## How Needs Develop
So the first sign of a need is a slight discontent or dissatisfaction. (Our 100 percent satisfaction with the existing situation becomes a 99.9 percent satisfaction.) 

A few months ago, for example, I could honestly say that I was com- pletely satisfied with the word processor I'm using to type this book. I had no need, and if you were selling word processors, I'd have been a wasted call. 

However, while writing this, I've become more aware of a few small imperfections. The automatic spelling check is cumbersome to use. Certain editing functions are a little complicated. My dissatisfac- tion isn't large, but ijt is there. I'm still not a good prospect for a new word processor, but the inevitable seeds of change are germinating— dissatisfaction exists and it's likely to grow.
What will happen next? Most probably it will gradually become clear to me that the editing limitations are a real nuisance. I'll perceive sig- nificant problems and difficulties, not just a minor dissatisfaction. And at this point it will become very much easier for somebody to interest me in a new machine.
But my perception of a problem, even if the problem is severe, doesn't mean I'm ready to purchase. The final step in the development of a need is for the problem to be translated into a want, a desire, or an intention to act (Figure 3.2). I'm not going to buy a new word processor until I want to change. And when this happens, I'm ready to buy.


![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2014.50.07.png)

So we can say that needs normally:
• Start with minor imperfections.• Evolve into clear problems, difficulties, or dissatisfactions. 
• Finally become wants, desires, or intentions to act.

In small sales, as we've seen, these stages can be almost instantaneous. In larger sales the process may take months or even years.

* Implied Needs. Statements by the customer of prpblems, difficulties, and dissatisfactions. Typical examples would be "Our present system can't cope with the throughput," "I'm unhappy about wastage rates," or "We're not satisfied with the speed of our existing process."
* Explicit Needs. Specific customer statements of wants or desires. Typical examples would include "We need a faster system," "What we're looking for is a more reliable machine," or "I'd like to have a backup capability."

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2014.51.56.png)

But in larger sales, one of the principal differences between very successful and less successful salespeople is this:
• Less successful people don't differentiate between Implied and Explicit Needs, so they treat them in exactly the same way.• Very successful people, often without realizing they're doing so, treat Implied Needs in; a very different way than Explicit Needs.

The successful calls contained more than twice as many Implied Needs as the unsuccessful calls. This suggests that, in simple sales, the more Implied Needs you can uncover, the better your chance of getting the business.

But what about larger sales? Is the same thing true there? No, it's not. As the sale becomes larger, the relationship between Implied Needs and success diminishes (Figure 3.5). In one of our studies, we analyzed 1406 larger sales, where the average contract size was $27,000. We found that—unlike small |sales—there was no relationship between the number of Implied Needs the seller uncovered and the success of the call. Im- plied Needs are buying signals in small sales, but not in large.

What does this mean? Our interpretation is that, in larger sales, the sheer quantity of Implied Needs—or customer problems—that you un- cover doesn't have much influence on the outcome of the call. Instead, Implied Needs are just a starting point, the raw material that successful salespeople use as part of their needs-development strategy. What mat- ters in the larger sale isn't the number of Implied Needs you uncover, but what you do with them after you've uncovered them. 

## Why Implied Needs Don't Predict Success in Larger Sales

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2014.55.59.png)

## Anyone making a decision to purchase must balance two opposing factors. One of these factors is the seriousness of the problems that the purchase would solve. The other is the cost of the solution. 

## The Value Equation

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2014.58.11.png)

This explains why you can sell successfully in smaller sales, where the cost of the solution is generally low, just by uncovering problems, or Im- plied Needs. And it also explains why, in major sales, you must develop the need further so that it becomes larger, more serious, and more acute in order to justify the additional cost of your solution. Remember that in larger sales the cost isn't measured only in terms of money. As I said earlier, a bad decision can cost the buyer's job. The buyer often perceives significant risks and hassles.


## Explicit Needs and Success
So, in larger sales, Implied Needs don't predict success, but Explicit Needs do. In smaller sales, both Implied Needs and Explicit Needs are success predictors. What does this mean in terms of your questioning strategy? In the smaller sale, a strategy that uncovers problems (Implied Needs) and then offers solutions can be very effective. In larger sales this is no longer the case. A probing strategy for the larger sale must certainly start by uncovering Implied Needs, but it can't stop there. Successful questioning in the larger sale depends, more than anything else, on how Implied Needs are developed—how they are converted by questions into Explicit Needs.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.08.30.png)

In contrast, Explicit Needs are the buying signals that predict success in larger sales. We've observed that as salespeople grow more experienced, they usually give more weight to Explicit Needs as buying signals in judging how successful a call has been. Less experi- enced people put too much weight on Implied Needs.## In contrast, let's hear how a very successful seller from the same sales organization judges call success. She's one of the top five performers in her region, which contains over 400 salespeople.

NTERVIEWER: Was this a successful call?SELLER: Difficult Sto tell. I found a few problems we could solve, but untilI've had a chance to go back and develop them more, I'd prefer to hold judgment on whether we're going to get anywhere.INTERVIEWER: Does that mean you don't see the problems you uncovered as "buying signals"?SELLER: Indirectly they are, I guess. After all, you don't get anywhere un- less you find some problems you can handle. So no problems means no sale—and that's a kind of negative signal—those are the worst calls. But I wouldn't really say that problems are positive buying signals.INTERVIEWER: In general, what are the buying signals that tell you a call's successful?*SELLER: It's when you hear the customer talking about action. Things like "I'm going tci overhaul our data network next year" or "We're looking for a system with these three characteristics." It's things like that.*INTERVIEWER: You know about the difference between Implied and Explicit Needs. It sounds like you're saying that Explicit Needs are a better signal man Implied Needs. Would mat be right?SELLER: Yes. You can't just rely on problems, you've got to have something stronger. That's why I think that the big skill in selling isn't so much get- ting the customer to admit to problems. Almost everyone I call on has problems, but that doesn't mean they'll buy. The real skill is how you grow those problems big enough to get action. And when the customer starts talking about action, that's when I hear "buying signals."

# The purpose of questions in the larger sale is to uncover Implied Needs and to develop them into Explicit Needs.
# Chapter 4: The SPIN Strategy
## Situation Questions
What's the commqn factor in all these questions? Each one collects facts, information, and background data about the customer's existing situation. So we gave them the obvious name, Situation Questions (Figure 4.1).

• Situation Questions are not positively related to success. In calls that succeed, sellers ask fewer Situation Questions than in calls that fail.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.14.26.png)

• Inexperienced salespeople ask more Situation Questions than do those who have longer sales experience.• Situation Questions are an essential part of questioning, but they must be used carefully. Successful salespeople ask fewer Situation Questions. Each one they ask has a focus, or purpose.• Buyers quickly become bored or impatient if asked too many Situation Questions.

These findings are easy to explain. Ask yourself who benefits from Situation Questions, the buyer or the seller? Clearly it's the seller. A busy customer doesn't generally derive great delight and happiness from giving a salesperson detail after detail of his or her situation.

## Problem Questions
Experienced salespeople are most likely to ask questions like these:

* Are you satisfied with your present equipment?* What are the disadvantages of the way you're handling this now? 
* Isn't it difficult to process peak loads with your present system? 
* Does this old machine give you reliability problems?

What's the common factor in all these questions? Each one probes for problems, difficulties, or dissatisfactions. Each invites the customer to state Implied Needs. We called them Problem Questions (Figure 4.2), and our research found that:

## In larger sales, however, Problem Questions are not strongly linked to sales success. There's no evidence that by increasing your Problem Questions you can increase your sales effectiveness.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.18.35.png)

However, Problem Questions are much less strongly linked to success in larger sales (Figure 4.4). This is because Implied Needs, as we saw in Chapter 3, don't predict success in large sales. The purpose of Problem Questions is to uncover Implied Needs. So if Implied Needs don't pre- dict success in the larger sale, neither should Problem Questions.

*Japan Case (EXCEPTION):* Working with the Engineering Products Division of Fuji Xerox, Imai found that despite the barriers to asking them, Problem Questions were indeed higher in successful calls. When a group of salespeople was trained in probing skills that included Problem Questions, its sales rose by 74 percent compared with an untrained control group. In this case, Problem Questions were powerfully linked to success in a large sale.

*Simple sales*
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.21.52.png)

*Larger sales*
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.22.13.png)

## Implication Questions
Most experienced salespeople, put in front of a major-account cus- tomer, are able to do an adequate job of asking Situation and Problem Questions. Unfortunately, this is where most people's probing stops. In small sales you can be very successful if you uncover problems and then demonstrate that you can solve them—so a selling style based only on Situation and Problem Questions can be very effective. However, even though many people use this style in larger sales, it isn't effective in the larger sales.

*This small example should illustrate why:*SELLER: (Situation Question) Do you use Contortomat machines in this di- vision?BUYER: Yes, we've got three of them.SELLER: (Problem Question) And are they difficult for your operators touse?BUYER: (Implied Need) They are rather hard, but we've learned how to getthem working.SELLER: (offering a solution) We could solve that operating difficulty foryou with our new Easiflo system.BUYER: What does your system cost?SELLER: The basic system is about $ 120,000 and...BUYER: (amazed) $120,000!!! Just to make a machine easier to use! Youmust be kidding.

## What's happened here? The buyer perceives a small Implied Need— "They are rather hard"—but certainly doesn't see that the problem jus- tifies a $120,000 solution. In terms of the value equation (Figure 4.5), the problem isn't big enough to balance the high cost of solving it.
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.33.33.png)


In larger sales, however, it’s clearly not sufficient to uncover problems and offer solutions. What should the seller have done? It's here that Im- plication Questions become so important to success. Let's see how a more skilled seller would have used Implication Questions to develop the seriousness of the problem before offering a solution:

SELLER: (Problem Question) And are they difficult for your operators to use?BUYER: (Implied Need) They are rather hard, but we've learned how to get them working.SELLER: (Implication Question) You say they're hard to use. What effect does this have on your output?BUYER: (perceiving the problem as small) Very little, because we've specially trained three people who know how to use them.
SELLER: (Implication Question) If you've only got three people who can use them, doesn't that create work bottlenecks?BUYER: (still seeing the problem as unimportant) No, it's only when a Contortomat operator leaves that we have trouble while we're waiting for a replacement to be trained.SELLER: (Implication Question) It sounds like the difficulty of using these machines may be leading to a turnover problem with the operators you've trained. Is that right?BUYER: (recognizing a bigger problem) Yes, people certainly don't like using the Contortomat machines, and operators generally don't stay with us for long.SELLER: (Implication Question) What does this turnover mean in terms of training cost?BUYER: (seeing more) It takes a couple of months before an operator gets proficient, so that's maybe $4000 in wages and benefits for each opera-tor. On top of that we pay Contortomat $500 to put new operators through off-site training in their Southampton plant. So add perhaps f 1000 for travel costs. You know, that's about $5000 for each operator we train—and I guess we must have trained at least five this year al- ready.SELLER: SO that's more than $25,000 in training costs in less than 6 months. (Implication Question) If you've trained five people in 6 months, it sounds like you've never had three fully competent operators at any time: how much production loss has this led to?BUYER: Not much. Whenever there's been a bottleneck, we've persuaded the other operators to work overtime, or we've sent work outside.SELLER: (Implication Question) Doesn't the overtime add even more to your costs?BUYER: (realizing the problem is quite serious) Yes, we've been paying over- time at two and a half times the normal job rate. Even with the addi- tional pay, the operators aren't very willing to work the extra hours— which I'm sure is one of the reasons we're getting such high turnover.SELLER: (Implication Question) I can see how sending the work outside must also increase your costs, but is that the only implication of sending work out? Is the quality of work affected, for example?BUYER: That's what I'm most unhappy about. I can control the quality of everything we produce internally, but when anything goes outside I'm at the mercy of other people.SELLER: (Implication Question) And presumably, being forced to send work outside also puts you at the mercy of other people's delivery schedules? BUYER: Don't talk about it! I've just spent 3 hours on the phone chasing alate delivery.SELLER: (summarizing) So from what you've said, because your Contort-omat machines are so difficult to use, you've spent $25,000 in training costs this year and you're getting expensive operator turnover. You've bottlenecks in production, and these result in expensive overtime and force you to send jobs outside. But sending jobs outside isn't satisfactory, because you're losing quality and getting late deliveries.BUYER: When you put it that way, those Contortomat machines are creating a very serious problem indeed.

## What effect ha£ the seller had on the buyer's value equation? A small problem has nov| grown so much larger—and so much more costly— that a $120,000 solution no longer seems unreasonable (Figure 4.6). This is the central purpose of Implication Questions in larger sales. They take a problem that the buyer perceives to be small and build it up into a problem hrge enough to justify action.

## Professionals Often Sell Better than They Realize
There's another interesting thing about this car conversation. It wasn't a sales call; my friend knows nothing about selling. He's a consulting en- gineer who would run away in terror if you asked him to sell. Yet here he's doing a better job of developing my needs than 99 percent of the people whose job is to sell cars. Many professional people, particularly those who have to ask a lot of diagnostic questions as part of their work, can quickly and easily learn to use Implication Questions to help them sell.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.38.12.png)

# Where Implication Questions Work Best
Implication Questions are particularly powerful in certain types of sale. Obviously, as we've already seen, the main power of Implication Questions is in larger sales where it's necessary to increase the size of the problem in the customer's mind.

*But our research also found that Implication Questions are especially powerful in selling to decision makers. It's often possible to achieve a positive outcome from calls on users or influencers simply by asking Problem Questions, but with calls on decision makers it's not as easy. Decision makers seem to respond most favorably to salespeople who un- cover implications. Perhaps this is not surprising, for a decision maker is a person whose success depends on seeing beyond the immediate prob- lem to the underlying effects and consequences. You could say that a decision maker deals in implications. There have been many occasions when we've been talking to decision makers after a call and heard them comment favorably on salespeople who asked them Implication Ques- tions, saying things like "that person talked my language." Implications are the language of decision makers, and if you can talk their language, you'll influence them better.*

## A Potential Negative
Implication Questions aren't a new discovery. People were asking them long before we began our research. Throughout history, effective persuaders have been uncovering problems and making them bigger by exploring their implications.

## Need-Payoff Questions
Our research at Huthwaite showed that successful people use two types of questions to develop Implied Needs into Explicit Needs. First they use Implication Questions to build up the problem so that it's perceived to be more serious, and then they turn to a second type of question to build up the value or usefulness of the solution. It's the use of this sec- ond type of question to build up the positive elements of a solution that prevents any unfavorable perception from customers. We call these positive solution-centered questions Need-payoff Questions (Figure 4.8). Basically, they ask about the value or usefulness of solving a prob- lem. Typical examples include:
* Is it important to you to solve this problem? 
* Why would you find this solution so useful? 
* Is there any other way this could help you?

What's the psychology of Need-payoff Questions? They achieve two things:
• They focus the customer's attention on the solution rather than on the problem. This helps create a positive problem-solving atmosphere where attention is given to solutions and actions, not just problems and difficulties.
* They get the customer telling you the benefits. For example, a Need- payoff Question like "How do you think a faster machine would help you?" might get a reply like "It would certainly take away the production bottleneck and it would also make better use of skilled operator time."

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-05%20at%2016.45.22.png)

In this extract, Need-payoff Questions have succeeded in focusing cus- tomer attention oh solutions rather than problems. Even more impor- tant, the customer begins to give benefits to the seller, saying things like "Where it would really help us is in improving customer service." It's no wonder our research found that calls with a high number of Need- payoff Questions were rated by customers as:• Positive• Constructive 
• Helpful

By using Need-payoff Questions, you can get the customer to explain to you which elements of the problem your solution can solve. This approach reduces objections and makes your solution more acceptable, as the next example shows:

In smaller sales your success rests on how effectively you can convince the person you sell to, but this is not always the case in larger sales. As the size of the decision grows, more people become involved. Your suc- cess may often depend not just on how you sell, but on how well the people in the account sell to each other. In the small sale you're usually there during the whole sales process. But in larger sales there are likely to be many "sales calls" where influencers and users sell internally on your behalf and where there's no opportunity for you to be present.

The most important thing to remember about really big sales is that you only play a small part in the selling. The real selling goes on in the account when you're not there—when the people you sold to go back and try to convince the others.

So there's no escaping the fact that in larger sales, a major part of the selling—perhaps most of it—will be done by your internal supporters while you're not there. This brings us back to the question of how you best prepare a customer to sell on your behalf, which is another area where Need-payoff Questions have a special use. In the next example, the seller uses Need-payoff Questions in a way that will help the buyer sell internally after the call is over:*In summary, Need-payoff Questions are important because they focus attention on solutions, not problems. And they make customers tell you the benefits. Need-payoff Questions are particularly powerful selling tools in the larger sale because they also increase the acceptability of your solution. Equally important, success in large sales depends on internal selling by customers on your behalf, and Need-payoff Questions are one of the best ways to rehearse the customer in presenting your solutions convincingly to others.*

"That one, that one, and that one are Implication Questions and all the others are Need-payoff Questions." We were taken aback—we'd come to the same conclusion but we'd needed half an hour to do it."How can you tell?" we asked."Easy," he said. "Implication Questions are always sad. Need-payoff Questions are always happy."He's right, and since then we've called it Quincy's Rule, after its 8- year-old discoverer. Put in a more adult way, Implication Questions are problem-centered—they make the problem more serious—and that's why they are "sad." Need-payoff Questions, in contrast, are solution- centered (Figure 4.9).

P.91

## The SPIN Model
Asking questions that are important to the customer is what makes the SPIN model so powerful. Its questioning sequence taps directly into the psychology of the buying process. As we've seen, buyers' needs move through a clear progression from Implied to Explicit. The SPIN ques- tions provide a road map for the seller, guiding the call through the steps of need development until Explicit Needs have been reached (Figure 4.10).

## Most importantly, please don't see SPIN as a rigid formula. It's not. Selling by a fixed formula is a sure recipe for failure in larger sales. Instead, see the model as a broad description of how successful salespeople probe. Treat it as a guideline, not a formula.
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-10%20at%2014.29.46.png)

1. Initially, they ask Situation Questions to establish background facts. But they don't ask too many, because Situation Questions can bore or irritate the buyer.2. Next, they quickly move to Problem Questions to explore problems, difficulties, and dissatisfactions. By asking Problem Questions, they uncover the customer's Implied Needs.3. In smaller sales it could be appropriate to offer solutions at this point, but in successful larger sales the seller holds back and asks Implication Questions to make the Implied Needs larger and more ur- gent.
4. Then, once the buyer agrees that the problem is serious enough to justify action, successful salespeople ask Need-payoff Questions to en- courage the buyer to focus on solutions and to describe the benefitsthat the solution would bring.

Before I go into a call, I ask myself, "What problems can I solve for this customer?" The clearer I can be about the problems I can solve, the easier it is to ask effective questions during the discussion.

Here is a simple technique to help you plan your call strategy and questions:• Before the call, write down at least three potential problems which the buyer may have and which your products or services can solve.• Then write down some examples of actual Problem Questions that you could ask to uncover each of the potential problems you've identified.

Yet there's good evidence (see Appendix A if you're a doubter) that if you ask more Implication Questions, your calls will be more successful. 

# How to Plan Implication Questions
1. Write down a potential problem the customer is likely to have.2. Then ask yourself what related difficulties this problem might lead to, and write these down. Think of these difficulties as the implications of the problem—and be especially alert for those implications which reveal the problem to be more severe than it may originally have seemed.

As shown in Figure 4.11, for example, a seller planning a call has identified "Existing machine is hard to use" as a potential problem and has then thought of four related difficulties, one of which is that there may be a shortage of qualified people to operate the machine.
3. For each difficulty, write down the questions it suggests. For in- stance, in Figure 4.11 the seller has noted that the shortage of qual- ified people suggests Implication Questions about overtime costs and recruitment difficulties.

*This is a very simple method, but it works well. Even the smartest people we've studied find it hard to ask Implication Questions unless they've planned them in advance.*

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-10%20at%2014.37.19.png)

## Using Need-Payoff Questions Effectively
No other type of question has so con- sistently positive an effect on the customer. Consequently, it's still a sur- prise to me that in almost half the calls we studied the sellers didn't use any Need-payoff Questions at all. 

*Avoid Need-Payoff Questions Early in the Call.* Some people make the mistake of using Need-payoff Questions too early in the call, before they've identified the customer's problems. Paul Landauer of Abbott Laboratories tells the story of watching one of his salespeople open a call with the Need-payoff Question, "Mr. Customer, if I could show you something interesting, would you be interested?" In a less bizarre form, calls are often opened with questions like "If I could show you a way to increase productivity here, would you put my company on your bid list?" or "Would you be interested in a faster way to process your accounts?" These are Need-payoff Questions, but asked so early in the call, they are likely to put the customer on the defensive and thus be ineffective. The top performers we studied first built up needs before asking Need-payoff Questions.

*Practicing Effective Need-Payoff Questions.* Implication Questions require careful planning. Here's an example of a simple exercise that helps you practice Need-payoff Questions:

1. Get a friend or colleague to help you. The person you choose needn't know anything at all about selling. My son has been my "victim" for this exercise.2. Choose a topic about a need that you believe the other person has. You might, for example, choose to talk about a new car, a vacation, a change of job, or—as in my son's case—a video camera.3. Ask Need-payoff Questions to get the other person talking about the benefits of the topic under discussion. In my case, for example, I asked my son questions like these:• Why do you think it would be good to have a video camera? 
• What would it let us do that we can't do right now?
* Would anyone else in the family be pleased if we bought one?• Do you think it would have any cost advantages compared with Super 8 film?

When you try this exercise, notice two things about it

1. As in real life, it builds up noticeable enthusiasm in your "customer." A major-account seller from Xerox once told me that he tried out the exercise with a friend, using a new car as the topic. A week later she actually bought a new car, explaining to him, "Your questions really convinced me I should." The power of Need-payoff Questions is of- ten visible in these simple practice demonstrations. Watch for it.2. Unlike Implication Questions, which tend to be specific to a particular customer problem, Need-payoff Questions have wide generality. Many of the questions you'll use in this practice exercise are the same ones you can use in real calls. There are many generic Need-payoff Questions, such as these:• Why is that important?• How would that help?• Would it be useful if... ?• Is there any other way this could help you?

# Chapter 5: Giving Benefits in Major Sales
## Features and Benefits: The Classic Ways to Demonstrate Capability
In this chapter, I want to show you what Huthwaite's research found about the Demonstrating Capability stage (Figure 5.1).

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-10%20at%2014.44.19.png)

### Anybody who has been through a sales-training pro- gram in the last 60 years is likely to have been taught the terms Features and Benefits as the two ways that you can describe your products or services.

/We're all so familiar with the concept that it scarcely seems necessary to explain that Features are facts about a product and are unpersuasive, whereas Benefits—which show how Features can help the customer—are a much more powerful way to describe your capabilities./

## Features
Everybody knows what Features are. They are facts, data, or information about your products or services. Typical examples of Features include "This system has 512K buffer storage," "There is a four-stage exposure control," and "Our consultants have a background in educational psychology."

What does our research show? From an analysis of the number of Features used in 18,000 sales calls, we found the following (Figure 5.2):

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-10%20at%2014.47.47.png)


* Features are neutral. They don't help the call, but they don't harm it much either.
* In larger sales, Features have a negative effect when used early in the call and a neutral effect when used later.
* *Users respond more positively to Features than do decision makers.*
* In the middle of very complex selling cycles of technical products, the customer sometimes develops a "Features appetite." When this hap- pens, the customer demands considerable product detail and may respond positively to Features.

### But generally, our work on Features confirmed what writers have been saying for 50 years. Features are low- power statements that do little to help you sell. It's better to use Benefits than Features.

## What's a Benefit?
* *Type A Benefit.* This type shows how a product or service can be used or can help the customer.
* *Type B Benefit.* This type shows how a product or service meets an Explicit Need expressed by the customer.

For example, suppose I'm selling you a computer system and I say, "I assume you want a 32-bit system like our Suprox machine because, if you ever use graphics, it will be sig- nificantly faster for you." Have I made a Type A or a Type B state- ment? It can't be Type B for I've assumed that you want faster graphics; you haven't actually expressed a need for graphics, let alone faster ones.

Take another example. You tell me that your present machine has a reliability problem. I reply, "Because our Suprox machine uses a new generation of high-reliability components, it could solve your present reliability problem." What kind of statement is this? This time you've certainly expressed a need. You've told me that your present machine is unreliable. But have you expressed an Explicit Need? No; telling me that your present machine has a reliability problem is an Implied Need (a problem, difficulty, or dissatisfaction). So my statement meets an Im- plied Need, not an Explicit Need. Once again, we should classify it as a Type A Benefit, not a Type B.

*How Important Is the Difference?* In our research test we found that the Type A Benefit is quite strongly related to success in smaller sales but is only slightly related to success in larger sales. *In contrast, the Type B Benefit is very strongly related to success in all sizes of sales.*

*We called the Type A Benefit an "Advantage." And for the Type B Benefit, because it was so strongly related to success, we kept the name "Benefit."*

But as you can see in Figures 5.3 and 5.4, Advantages are more powerful in simpler sales than they are in the larger sales that are the subject of this book.

## For example, the Motorola Canada productivity study described in Appendix A shows that salespeople who used Bene- fits rather than Advantages increased their dollar volume of sales by 27 percent. 
Because the differences be- tween Features, Advantages, and Benefits are so important

## The Relative Impacts of Features, Advantages, and Benefits
Remember that we showed how you could be very successful in smaller sales by us- ing Situation and Problem Questions to uncover Implied Needs and then offering solutions.What would these solutions be in terms of Features, Advantages, and Benefits? *They can't be Benefits because, as we've seen, you can only make a Benefit if you address an Explicit Need that the customer has expressed.**In this case the solutions are offered to Implied Needs, so they must be either Features or Advantages.* 

We've seen that offering solutions to Implied Needs isn't effective in larger sales. So this use of Features and Advantages, which can work perfectly well in a small sale, is likely to be ineffective as the sale grows larger (Figure 5.5).

### Recipe for success in the smaller sale
![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-11%20at%2010.00.59.png)

Explicit Need (Figure 5.6). But in order to get the Explicit Need, you normally must first develop it from an Implied Need by using Implication and Need-payoff Questions.

### “Do a good job of developing Explicit Needs and the Benefits almost look after them- selves." If you can get your customers to say, "I want it," it's not difficult to make a Benefit by replying, "We can give it to you."

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-11%20at%2010.02.45.png)

We compared the level of Benefits in 5000 calls with the outcome of each call (Figure 5.7). We found that Benefits (and re- member that our definition of a Benefit is a statement that shows how you can meet an expressed Explicit Need) were significantly higher in calls leading to Orders and Advances.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-11%20at%2010.03.37.png)

## Features, Advantages, and Benefits in the Longer Selling Cycle
One of the curious findings from our research was that the impacts of Features, Advantages, and Benefits on the customer are not similar throughout the selling cycle (Figure 5.8). *The average selling cycle in this organization was 7.8 calls long.*

As you can see in Figure 5.8, Features had a low impact on the cus- tomer throughout the selling cycle. Benefits, at the other extreme, had a high impact whenever they were used. Advantages had an unusual be- havior. We found that early in the cycle, particularly during the first call, Advantages had a moderately good statistical relationship to call success. This is another way of saying that Advantages had a positive impact on the customer during the first call

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-11%20at%2010.06.01.png)

Advantages were likely to get an Advance rather than a Continuation or No-sale. However, as the cycle progressed, Advantages had a decreasing effect on the customer until, as the end of the cycle approached, they were no more powerful than Features.

### Why Do Advantages Run Out of Steam?

To be honest, I'm not sure why Advantages are more effective early in the cycle than late. It's one of those findings which the Huthwaite re- search team still argues about whenever we get together. Possibly it's be- cause, at a first meeting, the customer expects to hear about the product rather than to discuss needs. I'm sure you've often made first visits to customers who start off the call by saying "Now tell me all about this product of yours." I've certainly had customers who don't want to dis- cuss needs until they know more about what I've got to offer.Another possibility is that many of the sellers who jump in early with Advantages do so because they are genuinely enthusiastic about their products. They can't wait to start talking solutions. In the short term, their enthusiasm carries them along, at least to the point where the customer agrees to proceed to a further step in the selling cycle. *However, if they continue a product-centered approach as the cycle progresses*, they aren't responsive to customer needs and therefore become less effective.

A third possibility is that Advantages, as we've seen earlier, are very quickly forgotten after the call; Consequently, their effect is temporary. In contrast, Benefits continue to have an impact between calls because their link to Explicit Needs helps customers remember them.

### The research is giving us a simple but important message. Advantages are less powerful than Benefits all through the selling cycle. It never pays to offer an Advantage if you can go that bit further and offer a Benefit.

## Selling New Products
From the many product launches we've studied, one constant fact emerges. The biggest single cause of poor results early in a product's life can be explained in terms of Features, Advantages, and Benefits.### The Bells-and-Whistles Approach
When a product is new, how does product marketing generally communicate it to the sales force? The marketing people call the sellers together and tell them about what an exciting new product is coming. They explain all the Features and Advantages—all the bells and whistles. And what do the salespeople then do? They become excited about the product and go out to sell it. And when they are in front of customers, how do they behave? They communicate the product in exactly the same way it was communicated to them. Instead of asking questions to develop needs, they jump in with all the exciting Features and Advantages that the new product possesses.

Figure 5.9 shows the composite data from a number of product launches. As you can see, the average number of Features and Advantages given when selling new products is more than 3 times the level given by the same salespeople when selling existing products. The evidence suggests that the sellers' attention is much more on the product than on their customers. To be frank, I've done it myself—you've prob- ably done the same thing too. Whenever Huthwaite launches a new product, we all get excited and enthusiastic, and we can't wait to tell our clients all about it. And like so many other companies, we wonder why— despite our enthusiasm—we're not making sales. We now understand that it's precisely because of our enthusiasm that we have a problem. Our enthusiasm has led us to become product-centered and to give Features and Advantages. As we've seen in this chapter, that's not an effective strategy for the major sale.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-11%20at%2010.13.38.png)


### The Problem-Solving Approach

By launching the product in terms of the problems it solved and how to probe for them, we were able to shift our small group's attention away from the product and back to customer needs. The proof that this was an effective strategy is in the sales results. Our group averaged a 54 percent higher level of sales than the rest of the sales force during the product's first year.

There's a lesson here for anybody concerned with successful product launches. Several of our large multinational clients, on the basis of Huthwaite's research, now handle launches in a new way. Instead of giving Features and Advantages when they announce new products to the sales force, they concentrate on explaining the problems the product solves and on thinking up the questions that will uncover and develop these problems. It's proved a very successful method for speeding the growth curve of new-product sales.

## Demonstrating Capability Effectively
What are the central messages in this chapter that will help you demonstrate your capability more effectively in larger sales? 

1. *Don't demonstrate capabilities too early in the call.* In smaller sales you can uncover a problem and jump straight in with Advantages about how you can solve it, but this doesn't work well in larger sales. It's important in larger sales to develop Explicit Needs—by using Implication and Need-payoff Questions—before you offer solutions. Presenting capabilities too soon is one of the most common mistakes in large ac- counts. It's made worse because many customers will encourage you to present solutions in the absence of any information about needs. "Just come and make a presentation about your product," they tell you, "and we'll decide whether it fits our needs." If you're forced to make presentations of Features and Advantages early in the selling cycle, always try to have a minimum of one premeeting with a key person in the account to uncover needs, so that your presentation includes at least some Benefits.
2. *Beware Advantages.* Most sales training, because it's based on models appropriate to smaller sales, encourages you to give Advantage statements when you sell. And to complicate the issue, the term they use for such statements is "Benefits." Don't let previous training mislead you. Remember that, in larger sales, the powerful statements are those which show that you can meet Explicit Needs. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're giving a lot of Benefits if you're not uncovering and meeting those Explicit Needs.
3. *Be careful with new products.* Most of us give far too many Features and Advantages when we're selling new products. Don't let this happen to you. Instead, the first thing to ask yourself about any new product is "What problems does it solve?" When you understand the problems it solves, you can plan SPIN questions to develop Explicit Needs. Try it. You'll be much more effective.

### ANSWERS: Types of Product Statements

1. Feature. Balanced voltage stabilization is a fact about the system. The statement doesn't explain how stabilization can be used or can help the customer.2. Advantage. This statement shows how the Feature in statement 1 can be used or can help the customer. It's not a Benefit because the customer hasn't expressed an Explicit Need for stabilization.3. Advantage. The statement shows how backup memory can be used or can help the customer, so it's more than just a Feature. But because there's no evidence that the customer has expressed an Ex- plicit Need for backup memory, we can't call it a Benefit.4. Feature. Statements of cost (like this one) are facts or data about the product, so we classify them as Features.5. Benefit. In the previous statement the customer has expressed an Explicit Need: "I need to be able to read source data straight into memory." In this statement the seller shows how the product meets that Explicit Need.6. Benefit. Again, the buyer has stated an Explicit Need (an error rate less than 1 in 100,000). The seller shows that his product can easily meet the need.7. Advantage. The seller shows another way in which having a low error rate can be used or can help the customer. However, as the next customer statement shows, this doesn't meet a need.8. Feature. A piece of data about the product.9. Feature. Further product facts.10. Advantage. The seller shows how the Feature of time-based cod- ing can be used to help the customer.

# Chapter 6: Preventing Objections
• Skilled people receive fewer objections because they have learned objection prevention, not objection handling.

For example, when sellers use a lot of Features in calls, do customers respond in a different way than in calls where fewer Features are used? She discovered that Features, Advantages, and Benefits each produce a different behavioral response from customers (Figure 6.2).

Figure 6.1. Features, Advantages, and Benefits.

# Features and Price Concerns
Customers are most likely to raise price concerns in calls where the seller gives lots of Features. Why is this? It seems that the effect of Features is to increase the customer's sensitivity to price. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you happen to be selling low-cost products that are relatively rich in Features.

Consider the psychology of the advertisement shown in Figure 6.3. This features-rich product is being sold in a way that works well with cheaper goods. When the product turns out to be much cheaper than its competition, the increased price sensitivity causes the buyer to feel extra positive about the lower price tag.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-12%20at%2017.01.17.png)

Throughout his- tory, using Features this way has helped sell lower-priced goods. Why? Because Features increase price sensitivity. By listing all the Features, the customer comes to expect a higher price. 

### Now consider the advertisement shown in Figure 6.4. This watch is almost 100 times as expensive as the one in Figure 6.3. Do you think you'd be more likely to buy this expensive watch if there was a list of Features down the side of the advertisement to help persuade you? Not on your life! With top-of-the-market products, the price concern created by Features will make people less likely to buy. A list of Features would probably make you ask yourself questions about whether the ex- pensive watch was worth it.

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-12%20at%2017.02.49.png)

The answer lay in their use of Features. While selling for the cheaper competitor, these salespeople had developed a selling style very high in Features. This was very successful because, as we've seen, Features in- crease customers' price concerns. But because their product was cheaper, the price concern worked to their advantage. Now that they were selling for a more expensive competitor, the high level of Features they were giving worked against them. Their Features increased price concern and, because their product was more expensive, this turned customers toward the cheaper competitor.

## Advantages and Objections
Perhaps the most fascinating of the links that Linda Marsh found is the strong relationship between Advantages and objections. Advantages create objections—and this is one reason why they are poorly linked to success in the large sale.

To help understand the link between Advantages and objections, consider the following extract from an actual sales call.

SELLER: (Problem Question) Does all this retyping waste time?BUYER: (Implied Need) Yeah, some. But there's not so much of it here, notlike in Fort Worth.SELLER: (Advantage) Here's where our word processors would be a real bighelp because they'd eliminate that retyping for you.BUYER: (objection)Look, we retype stuff, sure. But you won't get me payingfor fancy $15,000 machines just to cut down on some retyping.SELLER: (Advantage) I understand you, but the labor costs of retyping can climb out of sight. A big plus of word processors is that they save youmoney by making your people more efficient.BUYER: (objection) We're very efficient right now—and if I wanted to dobetter on efficiency I can think of 16 ways without new word processors. I've two xxx word processors there in the back office. Nobody much knows how to use them. They give trouble, just trouble.SELLER: (Problem Question) Those xxx machines are hard for your people to use?BUYER: (Implied Need) Yes, it's quicker to type it out by hand—doing it the old way.SELLER: (Advantage) We really can help you there. Our yyy machines use a screen, so people can see exactly what they're doing. That's a lot better than your old xxx's where you've got to remember things like format codes—which we prompt automatically, so that our machine can be usedmuch more easily.BUYER: (objection) Know what? Some of the ladies working here get up-tight about a typewriter with a correcting ribbon. Screen? It'd just con- fuse the hell out of them. I'd end up with more mistakes than I'm get- ting now.SELLER: (Problem Question) You're getting too many mistakes?BUYER: (Implied Need) Some. Well, no more than most offices, but morethan I like.SELLER: (Advantage) Tests show that with the full-screen editing and errorcorrection we offer, your error rates would drop by more than 20 per-cent if you used our machines.BUYER: (objection) Yeah, but it's not worth all that hassle just to get rid of afew typos.

What's happened here? The first thing you'll notice is that every Ad- vantage is followed by an objection.

But from our research, objections are a more likely response than any other buyer behavior (Figure 6.5).

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-12%20at%2017.10.24.png)

## As you can see, the fundamental problem that's causing the objection is that the seller offered a solution before building up the need. The buyer doesn't feel that the problem has enough value to merit such an expensive solution. Consequently, when the seller gives the Advantage, the buyer raises an objection.

This explains why Advantages have a more positive effect in small sales. If the word processor had cost $15 instead of $15,000, the buyer would probably have reacted differently. It's certainly worth $15 to eliminate retyping. But $15,000? That's a different matter.

### Back to Symptoms and Causes

Teaching her how to handle objections treats the symptom, but it doesn't alter the cause. *The fundamental sell- ing disease—jumping in too soon with solutions—remains malignant and untreated.*

### The Cure
If objection handling just treats a symptom, how would we set about a complete cure? This is where the SPIN Model comes in. By teaching her to probe in a way that builds value, we can prevent the objection from arising in the first place.

SELLER: (Problem Question) You're getting too many mistakes?BUYER: (Implied Need) Some. Well, no more than most offices, but morethan I like.SELLER: (Advantage) Tests show that with the full-screen editing and errorcorrection we offer, your error rates would drop by more than 20 per-cent if you used our machines.BUYER: (objection) Yeah, but it's not worth all that hassle just to get rid of afew typos.
*The customer has raised the objection because he doesn't perceive sufficient value from reducing the error rate.*

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-13%20at%2009.44.21.png)

*Let's look at how a more skilled person would handle the same situation:*

SELLER: (Problem Question) You're getting too many mistakes?BUYER: (Implied Need) Some. Well, no more than most offices, but morethan 1 like.SELLER: (Implication Question) You say "more than you'd like. Does thismean that some of those mistakes are causing you difficulties in docu-ments you send out to clients?BUYER: Sometimes that's happened, but not often, because I proofread allimportant documents carefully before 1 send them out.SELLER: (Implication Question) Doesn't that take up a lot of your time? BUYER: TOO much. But it's better than letting a document go out with a mis-take—particularly if it's a mistake in the figures that go out to a client.
SELLER: (Implication Question) Why would that be? Are you saying that a mistake in the figures would lead to more serious consequences with cli- ents than a mistake in the text would?BUYER: Oh yes. We could lose a bid, or commit ourselves to an uneconomic contract—or even just come across to clients as sloppy. People judge you on things like that. That's why it's worth a couple of hours a day proof- reading when there's other things I should be doing.SELLER: (Need-payoff Question) Suppose you didn't have to spend that time proofreading. What could you do with the time you saved?BUYER: Well, I could give some time to training my office people.SELLER: (Need-payoff Question) And this training would lead to improvedproductivity?BUYER: Oh, very much. At the moment, you see, people don't know how touse some of the equipment here—that graph plotter for example—sothey have to wait until I'm free to do it.SELLER: (Implication Question) So the time you're spending in proofing alsoforces you to become a bottleneck for other people's work?BUYER: Yes. I'm badly overloaded.SELLER: (Need-payoff Question) Then anything that reduced the timeyou're spending in proofing wouldn't just help you, it would also helpthe productivity of others? BUYER: Right.
SELLER: (Need-payoff Question) I can see how by reducing proofreading you could ease the present bottleneck. Is there any other way that having fewer mistakes in documents would help you?BUYER: Sure. People here hate retyping. It might be a plus in terms of their motivation if fewer mistakes meant less time spent in retyping.SELLER: (Need-payoff Question) And presumably less time in retyping would also bring cost savings?BUYER: You're right. And that's something I need to do.SELLER: (summarizing) So it seems that the present level of mistakes is lead- ing to expensive retyping, which creates a motivation problem with your people. If mistakes, particularly in Figures, get out to your clients, it can be very damaging. You're trying to prevent that at the moment by spending 2 hours a day proofing all key documents. But that's turning you into a bottleneck, reducing everyone's productivity and preventingyou from putting time into training your staff.BUYER: When you put it that way, those mistakes in documents are reallyhurting us. We can't just ignore the problem—I've got to do somethingabout it.SELLER: (Benefit) Then let me show you how our word processor wouldhelp you cut mistakes and reduce proofing...

*If we were to reexamine the customer's value equation now, it would probably look like the one in Figure 6.7.*

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-13%20at%2009.50.15.png)

Now the cost and hassle are more than counterbalanced by the value the seller has created through the use of Implication and Need-payoff Questions. It's a much more effective piece of selling because we've at- tacked the cause of the objection.

## Objection Prevention: A Case Study
There was an enormous difference in the number of objections faced by individual salespeople. In the average team they of- ten found one salesperson having to face 10 times as many objections per selling hour as other people from the same team. The research staff didn't know about our work on the links between Advantages and objections. *Naturally, they drew the obvious conclusion: The people who were receiving so many objections must need training in objection handling.*

One quick look at their data told us what we needed to know. We picked the behaviour analysis figures for 10 people who were each receiving very high numbers of objections and who were clearly candidates for objection-handling training. In all 10 cases, these people were higher than average in the number of Advantages they used in their calls. 

As we'd promised, our training didn't say anything at all about objections or objection handling. Instead, we taught the eight people to develop Explicit Needs with the SPIN Model and then to offer Benefits.After the training, the company's researchers went out with the eight to count the number of objections they were now receiving in calls. The average number of objections per selling hour had fallen by 55 percent.

We carried out a study to find out whether objections were really "sales opportunities in disguise," as one training program put it. We counted the number of objections raised by customers in a sample of 694 calls collected from an international sample in a large business- machines corporation. Figure 6.8 shows the results. *As you can see, the higher the percentage of objections in the customer's behavior, the less likely that the call will succeed.*

### Preventing Objections from Your Customers

If you're receiving more objections from customers than you'd like, think about which is symptom and which is cause. Could it be that objections are just a symptom you've caused by offering your solutions too soon in the call? Try putting extra effort into effective needs development, using Implication and Need-payoff Questions. If you can build the value of your solutions, then you're much less likely to face objections.

/Here are two sure signs that you're getting unnecessary objections that can be prevented by better questioning:/
1. *Objections early in the call.* Customers rarely object to questions—unless you've found a particularly offensive way to ask them. Most objections are to solutions that don't fit needs. If you're getting a lot of objections early in the call, it probably means that instead of ask- ing questions, you've been prematurely offering solutions and capabilities. *The cure is simple enough: Don't talk about solutions until you've asked enough questions to develop strong needs.*
2. *Objections about value.* If most of the objections you receive raise doubts about the value of what you offer, then there's a good chance that you're not developing needs strongly enough. Typical value objections would be "It's too expensive," "I don't think it's worth the trouble of changing from our existing supplier," or "We're happy with our existing system." In cases like these, customer objections tell you that you haven't succeeded in building a strong need. The solution lies in better needs development, not in objection handling. Particularly if you're get- ting a lot of price objections, cut down on the use of Features and, in- stead, concentrate on asking Problem, Implication, and Need-payoff Questions.

# Chapter 7: Preliminaries: Opening the Call
In this chapter I want to examine Preliminaries more closely. To be honest, the Huthwaite research team didn't find the Preliminaries stage of the call very exciting when compared with the central areas of Investigating and Demonstrating Capability. Perhaps this is our personal bias. At any rate, it meant that we did much less research about this stage than about the other three (Figure 7.1).

![](Spin%20Selling%20Book/Spin%20Selling%20Book/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-13%20at%2010.05.30.png)

Before examining these questions, I should note that in discussing Preliminaries in the larger sale, this chapter simplifies the situation by talking mainly about first meetings with new customers. As we know, of course, most larger sales involve several calls and are likely to be with customers with whom we already have an established relationship; *with some major-account groups I've known, less than 5 percent of their calls were first-time meetings with new customers.*

## First Impressions
But don't believe that tiny details will make a big difference to your sales success in the Preliminaries stage of the sale. As we've seen, the far more important and more durable impressions are made during the In- vestigating stage.

## Over and over again I've seen successful calls that started in a nondescript or even awkward manner, and I've seen tremendously smooth openings lead nowhere. Over the years I've come to doubt the importance of first impressions during the Preliminary stage of the call. I no longer believe that first impressions can make or break your sales success in larger sales.

## Conventional Openings
Since the 1920s, salespeople have been taught that there are two successful ways to open a call:

1. Relate to the buyer's personal interests. The conventional sales wisdom says that if you can somehow tap into an area of personal interest, then you can form a relationship more quickly and the call will be more successful.For example, if your buyer has a photograph of children on the desk, discuss family interests; if there's a golf trophy in die office, talk golf.
2. Make an opening benefit statement. Begin with some dramatic statement about the benefits your product can offer. For example, you might say, "Ms. Customer, in today's marketplace productivity is the central concern of key executives like yourself—and our product will contribute to your productivity."

*Our evidence suggests that, while these two methods might be suc- cessful in smaller sales, there's little to show that they help you when the sale is larger.* 

But it was a different story in the large urban stores, where the aver- age sale was more than 5 times the size. We found no relationship be- tween success and reference to personal issues. Therefore, it seemed that relating to the buyer's personal interests might be a less effective technique in larger sales. 

There's another reason why it may not be successful to open the call around a personal point. I once worked with the central purchasing group of British Petroleum. On the wall of his office, one of the buyers had a picture of a racing yacht. "I keep it there because it improves my efficiency," he told me. Puzzled, I asked him to explain. "I get salespeople coming in here every day," he said, "wasting my time by talking about a lot of nonbusiness issues. Obviously they're fishing for some personal area that will catch my interest. But I'm a busy professional purchaser—and I couldn't get through the day if I wasted time on conversation that isn't directly business-related. So I use the picture to in- crease my productivity. When new sales reps visit me for the first time, they usually say, 'What a beautiful picture. You must really enjoy sail- ing.' I reply, 'I hate sailing. That picture's there to remind me how much time gets wasted out on the water. Now what did you want to see me about?'"

### Perhaps that's an extreme case, but I've heard many other professional buyers complain about salespeople who try to open calls by cultivating areas of personal interest. The last thing a busy buyer wants is to tell the tenth seller of the day all about his last game of golf.

The more senior the people you're selling to, the more they feel their time is at a premium, and the more impatience you're likely to generate if you dwell on nonbusiness areas.

## The Opening Benefit Statement
Many sales-training programs teach that the most effective way to begin the call is to make an opening benefit statement to catch the buyer's in- terest with some potential benefit of your product or service. So I might say, "Mr. Wilson, for a busy executive like yourself, I know that time is money. And I'm sure you waste a lot of time looking up telephone num- bers and dialing calls. With the Rackham Autodialer I could help save some of that time for you." If it's well done, an opening benefit state- ment can sound positive and businesslike. But is it an effective way to open calls?

### In our studies there was no re- lationship, one way or another, between the use of opening benefit statements and the success of the call.

What we found was this. The most effective salespeople we studied opened each call in a different way. Sometimes they might use an open- ing benefit statement, but frequently they would use some other start- ing point. Less effective people were the ones who tended to open each call in the same way. So those sellers who began every call with an open- ing benefit statement were likely to be less successful than those whojust used the technique occasionally.

He began with a classic opening benefit statement: "Mr. Rackham, you're a busy executive and I'm sure you're wondering whether it's worth 15 minutes of your time to talk with me. But if, as a result of that 15 minutes, you could save your company several thou- sand dollars, I'm sure you'd agree that it would be time well spent." So I gave him 15 minutes and was sufficiently impressed with his product to invite him back the following week to talk to us again. At the next meeting, with my office manager present, he began, "Mr. Rackham, I know you're busy, but if I could use 15 minutes of your time to show you how I could save your company thousands of dollars,..." The very opening that had made such a positive impression the first time around now sounded mechanical and irritating.There's another reason why the opening benefit statement may be in- effective. Successful salespeople talk about their products or services late in the sales call, but we've seen that less successful people begin talk- ing products and solutions very much earlier in the call.

*Take this simple example:*SELLER: (using opening benefit statement) Mr. Buzzard, we at Big Co know how important it is to produce professional-looking documents in a business like yours. That's why we invented the Executype typewriter. Using a special new system, the Executype gives a far finer Finish to your doc- uments than you can get from conventional word processors.BUYER: (asking the questions) Oh. Does it use a daisy wheel?SELLER: (drawn into giving product details) No, it's an ink-jet process. BUYER: (still asking the questions) Inkjet? That must be very expensive, Ms.Simpson. What does it cost?SELLER: (forced into a price issue early in the call) Er...well, it is a littlemore expensive than conventional methods, but it's also got.

What's happened here? By making an opening benefit statement, the seller has been trapped in two ways:
• She's been forced to talk about product details too early in the sale, before she's had an opportunity to build value by using SPIN questions.• She's allowed the buyer to ask the questions and has therefore allowed him to take control of the discussion.Neither of these traps is irreversible. If she's smart, Ms. Simpson will recover the call, take over the questioning role from the buyer, and turn attention away from the product and back toward the customer's needs.


## A Framework for Opening the Call
Obviously, as I've suggested, variety is important. There isn't one best opening technique. But there is a framework that successful people use.

### Focusing on Your Objective
Let's examine the objective of the Preliminaries stage of a call. What's the purpose of your opening? At its very simplest, what you're trying to do is to get the customer's consent to move on to the next phase—the Investigating stage. You want customers to agree that it's legitimate for you to ask them some questions. In order to do this, you must establish:
• Who you are• Why you're there (but not by giving product details) 
• Your right to ask questions

Obviously there are many ways to open the call, but the common fac- tor of most good openings is that they lead the customer to agree that you should ask questions. In doing so, good openings keep you from getting into detailed discussions of products or services. Early in the call you want to establish your role as the seeker of information and thebuyer's role as the giver.

## Making Your Preliminaries Effective
Preliminaries, as we've seen, don't play a crucial role in the larger sale. The most important test of whether you're handling Preliminaries effectively is whether your customers are generally happy to move ahead and answer your questions. If so, then you're probably handling this stage of the call acceptably. Don't worry about appearing smooth and polished—some of the best salespeople we've studied have seemed nervous, self-conscious, or hesitant in the early minutes of the call. But do be concerned about these three points:
1. Get down to business quickly. Don't dawdle. The Preliminaries stage is not the most productive part of the call for you or for the customer. A common mistake, particularly for inexperienced salespeople, is spending too long on pleasantries. As a result, the call runs short of time—the customer has to stop just when you're getting to a critical point. 
2. Don't talk about solutions too soon. One of the most common faults in selling is talking about your solutions and capabilities too early in the call. As we've seen in previous chapters, offering solutions too soon causes objections and greatly reduces the chances that the call will succeed.
3. Concentrate on questions. Never forget that the Preliminaries aren't the most important part of the call. Often, when I've been traveling with salespeople, I've noticed that they waste time before a call worrying about how they should open it when they could be using that time far more effectively to plan some questions instead.

### Success in any skill— whether in golf, playing the piano, or selling—rests on concentrated, tedious, and frustrating practice. 


## The Four Golden Rules for Learning Skills
We have found that most people can greatly improve their ability to learn skills if they stick by four simple rules:

*Rule 1: Practice Only One Behavior at a Time:* Most people, when they work on improving their skills, try to do too much at once. I can imagine people reading this book and saying, "I'm going to cut out closing techniques, and in future I'll ask more Problem Questions. Then, instead of jumping in with solutions—which is what I usually do—I'll hold back and ask Implication Questions...oh, and Need-payoff Questions too, of course. And I'll also work on avoiding Features and Advantages; instead, I'll make more Benefits and..." STOP! People who successfully learn complex skills do so by practicing one behaviour at a time—not by half-practicing two, and certainly not by trying to handle 10 at once. So I was fascinated when Tom Landry explained a litde about the sophisticated and complex task of coaching a major football team. "Your job is teaching people skills," I prompted him. "If you had to put forward just one principle for successfully learning a skill, what would it be?" He didn't hesitate. *"Work on one thing at a time," he replied, "and get it right."* 

*Start by picking just one behavior to practice. Don't move on to the next until you're confident you've got the first behavior right.*

*Rule 2: Try the New Behaviour at Least Three Times:*  The first time you try anything new, it's bound to feel uncomfortable. It's not only new shoes that hurt at first. Suppose, for example, you decide to practice Implication Questions. You're keeping Rule 1 in mind, so you're going to concentrate only on Implication Questions, not on the other behaviors we've covered. Off you go into a call. Do the new Implication Questions roll off your tongue in a smooth, convincing sequence? Not on your life! When you ask them you sound self-conscious, artificial, and awkward. And be- cause of this, you don't make a particularly positive impression on the customer. After the call, if you're like most people we've trained, you're tempted to conclude that Implication Questions didn't help you sell—so you'd better drop them and try something different next call.*If you draw that conclusion, of course, you're making a big mistake.* You have to try any new behavior several times before it becomes practiced enough to be both comfortable and effective.

*Rule 3: Quantity Before Quality:* Remember the old-fashioned way to learn a foreign language? You try to say a few words. "No," says your teacher, "that's the incorrect tense— you should be using a pluperfect." You try again. "Wrong," the teacher warns you, "you've got the tense right, but this is an irregular verb." With some nervousness you make a third attempt. "No," your teacher tells you, "this time the tense is right and the verb is right, but your pronunciation is terrible." Notice that every one of the teacher's comments is about the quality of your skill. Many of us struggled for years to learn a language this way. At the end of it we were able, hesitantly but correctly, to pronounce a few sentences with the right verbs, tenses, and word orders. Most of us never reached the point, despite several years of emphasis on quality, where we could speak the language confidently and comfortably.In contrast, let's look at modern language training. Students are told, "Never mind about pronunciation, and don't worry about tenses. For now, word order doesn't matter and we don't care if you forget the differences between regular and irregular verbs. The only thing we want you to do is speak it, speak it, and speak it." The emphasis, in other words, is on quantity rather than quality—talking a lot is more important than talking well.

Our studies have consistently shown that the fastest way to learn a new sales behavior is through using a quantity method.
*When you're practicing, concentrate on quantity: use a lot of the new behavior. Don't worry about quality issues, such as whether you're using it smoothly or whether there might be a better way to phrase it. Those things get in the way of effective skills learning. Use the new behavior often enough and the quality will look after itself.*
*Rule 4: Practice in Safe Situations:* I once ran a negotiating-skills program for company presidents. On the last day, one of the participants asked me an innocent-sounding question. "Tomorrow," he explained, "I'll be going into the biggest negotiation of my career—I'm selling my company. What lessons from this program should I concentrate on during the negotiation?" I think my answer shocked him. "Forget every single thing you've heard on this program," I advised him; "otherwise, you'll spend the rest of your life regretting you came here."Let me give you some similar advice. If you've just finished this book and you're about to visit your most important account, then forget everything I've written. It's a strange quirk of human nature that we usually try to practice new skills in key situations, those important enough to justify the effort of trying something new. This is a terrible mistake. As we've seen, new skills are uncomfortable and awkward. They may even have a negative effect on the customer. If you try them out in crucial situations, then you're likely to be unsuccessful. Suppose you've decided to ask more Need-payoff Questions. Don't practice on your big- gest account. Instead, begin with small accounts, or with customers you know well, or in areas where you've nothing to lose if you fail. In other words:

*Always try out new behaviors in safe situations until they feel comfortable. Don't use important sales to practice new skills.*

These rules can be sequenced to provide a simple strategy for learning or improving your skills (Figure 8.1). Although my purpose here is to focus on improving selling skills, these four basic rules will help you im- prove any skills, from making love to flying airplanes.

# A Summary of the Call Stages
Let's summarize the key points made in earlier chapters.

### Four Stages of a Sales Call (Chapter 1)
Almost every sales call progresses through four distinct stages (Figure 8.2):• Preliminaries. The warming-up events at the start of the call• Investigating. Finding out facts, information, and needs• Demonstrating Capability. Showing that you've got something worthwhile to offer• Obtaining Commitment. Gaining an agreement to proceed to a fur- ther stage of the sale

## Investigating (Chapter 4)
Our research showed that the traditional distinction between open and closed questions doesn't predict success in larger sales. Instead, we dis- covered the SPIN sequence of questions that successful people use to uncover and develop customer needs in the larger sale:

• Situation Questions. About facts, background, and what the customer is doing now. Asking too many Situation Questions can bore or irritate the customer. Research shows that successful people ask them sparingly—so that each question has a purpose.• Problem Questions. About the customer's problems, difficulties, or dissatisfactions. Problem Questions are strongly linked to success in smaller sales, but they are less powerful in major sales.• Implication Questions. About the consequences or effects of a customer's problems. Successful calls usually contain a high level of Im- plication Questions. The ability to develop implications is a crucial skill in the larger sale because it increases the customer's perception of value in the solution you offer.
* Need-payoff Questions. About the value, usefulness, or utility that the customer perceives in a solution. Like Implication Questions, Need-payoff Questions are strongly linked to success in the major sale.


*The SPIN Model is often used sequentially, starting with Situation Questions to establish the background, then Problem Questions to un- cover difficulties, then Implication Questions to develop the seriousness of a problem, and finally Need-payoff Questions to get the customer telling you the benefits of your solution. However, the SPIN sequence isn't a rigid formula. To be effective, it must be used flexibly.*

### Demonstrating Capability (Chapter 5)The traditional definition of a Benefit—a statement that shows how your product can be used or can help the customer—works in small sales but fails as the sale grows larger. In major sales, the most effective type of Benefit shows how your product or service meets an Explicit Need expressed by the customer.### Obtaining Commitment (Chapter 2)Closing techniques are effective in smaller sales, but they don't work in larger ones. Our studies showed that the simplest way to obtain commitment is also the most effective:• Check that you've covered the buyer's key concerns. 
• Summarise the Benefits.• Propose an appropriate level of commitment.


*Focus on the Investigating Stage*Many people, when they plan calls, think about what they will tell the customer, not about what they will ask. They concentrate, in other words, on the Demonstrating Capability stage of the call. That's a mis- take. However well you demonstrate capability, you'll have little impact unless you have first developed needs—so that the customer wants the capability you're offering. The same is true of the Obtaining Commit- ment stage; unless the customer wants what you have to offer, you're going to find it difficult to get a commitment. Focus your efforts on the Investigating stage. Practice your questioning skills, and the other stages of the call will generally look after themselves. If you know how to develop needs—to get your customers to want the ca- pabilities you offer—then you'll have no problem showing Benefits or Obtaining Commitment. The key selling skill is in the Investigat- ing stage, using the SPIN questions to get your customers to feel a genuine need for your product.*Develop Questions in the SPIN Sequence*Don't rush in to practice the high-powered Implication and Need- payoff Questions until you feel you have a solid and comfortable grasp of the simpler Situation and Problem Questions.1. First decide whether you're asking enough questions of any type. If you've built up selling patterns that involve telling—in other words if you're giving a lot of Features and Advantages—then start by just ask- ing more questions. Most of the questions you ask will be Situation Questions, but this is fine. Just keep asking questions for a few weeks until asking feels as comfortable as telling.2. Next plan and ask Problem Questions. Aim, in the average call, to ask a customer about problems, difficulties, and dissatisfactions at least half a dozen times. Concentrate on building up the quantity of your Problem Questions; don't worry about whether or not each question is a "good" one.3. If you feel you're doing an effective job of uncovering customer problems, it's time to move on to Implication Questions. These are more difficult to ask, and you may need a couple of months' practice before you become entirely comfortable with Implication Questions. Plan them carefully.A good starting point would be to reread the example transcript in the "Implication Questions" section of Chapter 4. Then, in place of the problem in the transcript, put in a problem of your own that one of your products could solve for your customer. Using the questions in the transcript as a model, try to write some examples of Implication Ques- tions you could ask that would make your customer feel the problem is serious enough to justify action.. When I'm planning Implication Ques- tions, I find it's useful to imagine a customer who's saying "So what? Yes, I've got that problem—but I don't think it's serious." I list the ar- guments I'd use to convince the customer that the problem really is se- rious—it's causing a loss of efficiency, it's increasing her costs, and it's demotivating her better people. Then I turn each of my arguments into a question—"What effect is the problem having on your efficiency?" and "How much is it increasing your costs?" and "What impact does it have on the motivation of your better people?"4. Finally, when you're comfortable with Situation, Problem, and Im- plication Questions, turn your attention to Need-payoff Questions. In- stead of giving Benefits to the customer, concentrate on asking ques- tions that get the customer to tell you the Benefits. Ask questions like these:How would that help you?What do you see as the pluses of this approach?Is there any other way our product could be useful?Again, don't worry about whether you're asking Need-payoff Ques- tions well. Concentrate on quantity—on asking lots of them.



# Analyze Your Product in Problem-Solving Terms
Stop thinking about your products in terms of their Features and Ad- vantages. Instead, think of each product in terms of its problem-solving capabilities. Analyze products by listing the problems they are designed to solve. Then use your list to plan questions you can use in calls. By thinking of your products this way, you'll find it easier to adopt a SPIN questioning style.

*Plan, Do, and Review*The majority of salespeople acknowledge the importance of call plan- ning even if, in reality, their planning is no more than a few moments of anxiety before the call. However, only limited learning comes from planning the call, or from making it. The most important lessons come from the way you review the calls you make. After each call, ask yourself such questions as these:
• Did I achieve my objectives?• If I were making the call again, what would I do differently?• What have I learned that will influence future calls on this account?• What have I learned that I can use elsewhere?

Over the years I've had the opportunity to travel with dozens of the world's top salespeople—and as a researcher, I've looked for any differences that distinguish them from those who haven't made it to the top. Two differences stand out. The first is that the top people I've traveled with put great emphasis on reviewing each call—dissecting what they've learned and thinking about possible im- provement.The second difference is that most of the really successful salespeople I've studied recognize that their success depends on getting details right. They may have excellent skills in terms of broad, large-scale stra- tegic account planning, but this is not what distinguishes them. Many of the less successful people I've studied can give an impeccable account of themselves in terms of overall strategy. The difference that's so evident in top people is that they can translate strategy into effective sales be- havior—they know what to do in the call. They understand details, which may be why they put such emphasis on planning and reviewing each call.

It's worth asking yourself whether you are giving enough time to re- viewing the details of what happened in the call. Never be content with global conclusions like "it went quite well." Ask yourself about the de- tails. Did some parts of the call go better than others? Why? Which specific questions you asked had the most influence on the customer? Which needs did the customer feel strongly? Which needs changed during the discussion? Why? Which of the behaviors you used had the most impact? Unless you analyze your selling on this level of detail, you'll miss important opportunities for learning and improving your selling skills.

# Perhaps the most significant conclusion I've come to from Huthwaite's research studies of selling is about the importance of details. 

I'm not the first to come to the conclusion that success rests on understanding the minute details. So, as a parting word, let me urge you to concentrate on those minute particulars. Give real attention to the basic building-block behaviors you use when you sell. We've put thousands of sales calls under the micro- scope to isolate some of the detailed behavioral elements that bring success in the major sale. Use the results of our research to examine, develop, and improve the minute particulars of your selling skills.
