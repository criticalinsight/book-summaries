## Chapter 1: Time Management

I can absolutely help each one of them transform their business into the Ultimate Sales Machine. You can even expect this to be fast. I've doubled the sales of many companies in 12 months flat.

You know, Chet, your stuff has really helped me. But I gotta tell you, the most important lesson I learned from you was what you said about pigheaded discipline and determination.

It is the same with any business; there are basics that you can do over and over again until every aspect runs like a machine.

This is an example of how market data can motivate purchasing when people might not even feel they need the product. Product data like "We sell carpet cleaning" only appeals to people who think they need their carpets cleaned right now. The goal of most people when they get their carpets cleaned is to get them to look better. Little do people realize that it makes their home healthier. This puts cleaning your car- pets on the same level of importance as taking the kids for their yearly checkup.

### Building a sales machine is not going to be about doing 4,000 things; it's going to be about doing 12 things 4,000 times each.

We all get good ideas at seminars and from books, radio talk shows, and business-building gurus. The problem is that most companies do not know how to identify and adapt the best ideas to their businesses. Implementation, not ideas, is the key to real success.

To build your business into the Ultimate Sales Machine, you need to be in a primarily proactive mode.

To: StaffFrom: ChetDo not come to my door and ask if I have a minute. The answer will be no. Unless urgent, hold all thoughts, ideas, issues, or (nonurgent) concerns until the weekly division meeting. Below is a list of when these meetings will be held. Otherwise, I will post two times per day when I will take "got-a-minute" meetings. If your needs can't wait for the weekly meeting, write your name in the got-a-minute times allocated and I will take quick lO-minute meetings.

### When someone comes to your door with a "got-a-minute" meeting, you stop them cold and say, "Is this something that can't wait until the weekly meeting?"

## 6 Rules of Effective Time Management
*Step 1: Touch It Once:* If you touch it, take action. That's the first step to great time management. Don't open that email or letter until you're ready to deal with it.

*Step 2: Make Lists:* Lists help you stay focused on high priorities and highly productive matters. Keeping a list will double your productivity right away. So here's the rule: list the six most important things you need to do and, by hook or by crook, get those six things completed each day.

*Step 3: Plan How Much Time You Will Allocate to Each Task:* If one or more of the items on your list is too big to accomplish in one day, then write down how much time during that day you will dedicate to it. You will take care of bigger projects in manageable chunks of time.
*Step 4: Plan the Day:* But, most important, stick to that schedule no matter what. Note in the plan below that this is actually a 1O-hour day, but only 6.5 of the hours are for your six most important things.

*Step 5: Prioritize:* Now that you've done this exercise, look at your day tomorrow and see where you put the most difficult tasks. Put the most important task first. This simple step will give you a tremendous sense of control and accomplishment.

# If you are a one-person army or a very small company and you, as the entrepreneur, are the main person responsible for growing the company, then you personally must spend at least 2.5 hours per day growing your company.
*Step 6: Ask Yourself, "Will It Hurt Me to Throw This Away?”:*  Studies show that 80 percent of all filed or stored information is never referred to again. 

## Chapter 2: Training
Woodcutter A cuts wood all day. Woodcutter B keeps stopping and sitting down. At the end of the day, woodcutter B has three times more wood than woodcutter A. Woodcutter A asks: "How could this happen? You were resting all day!" Woodcutter B says: "I wasn't resting. I was sharpening my saw." Take time to sharpen your skills, your tools, and your resources, and you will be more productive.

On the other hand, banks like Wells Fargo, Banker's Trust, and Citibank-all former clients of mine-have classroom-style training programs with policies and procedures for everything. At one of these companies, Sam goes through extensive classroom training before he ever sits to observe another teller. When he finally sits down to do so, he can actually spot when she's doing something wrong.  	

With proper training, every employee will know the ideal procedure for initial contact with a client, the questions they need to ask every single client no matter what, and the follow-up procedures that you absolutely insist upon. The more proactive training you have, the better the ... everything in your organization.

*Repetition IS Key*
When designing your training programs, remember that repetition is the key to preprogramming your company or department to run like a ma- chine. The design of the Ultimate Sales Machine program was conceived with the simple law that no one gets good at anything without repetition. Karate requires tremendous discipline. You're just repeating moves over and over. This is true of tennis, golf, or any other sport. Practice, prac- tice, practice and then, when you've begun to master your moves so that you know what to do automatically, it gets exciting. But pigheaded disci- pline comes first. 

But it's not like you're going to magically turn everyone into a time management expert with a single training experience. What I do, in my own companies and with clients, is constantly teach the same information again and again until the skill is permanent. The skill improves again with another training session, but there is greater improvement because it's the same material being covered. 

## How to Run a Training Session
To begin a training session, people should be told what to expect:
• What will be covered 
• How long it will take
* How the information will be covered• The objective of the particular session• The obtained skill or knowledge that you hope they will gain

Since most of your staff will be reluctant to take time to train, you must make training fun, interesting, stimulating, and even an excit- ing experience. And above all, training must be mandatory. Put it on a schedule as a nonnegotiable commitment. 

*Test Before and After*For every concept or skill you teach, develop a test on that area for the staff. And if you really want to see your training stick, give staff the test before they take the training. That shows them how much they're going to learn and, more important, makes the answers stick when they learn it. Then, after the training, they take the tests again and feel accomplished when they get all the answers correct.
*The Spot Quiz*In the companies I've run, spot quizzes are an institution. The staff comes into the weekly meeting and I hand out a spot quiz like you used to get in school. The staff groans, laughs, and makes jokes, but little by little, whatever you cover, again and again, eventually sticks. What are the six steps to time management? The 12 steps to get an appointment? The seven steps to selling? The six questions they'll ask every prospect? They know the answers. I have had them so programmed that if you quizzed some salespeople who haven't worked for me in 10 years, they'd probably still be able to fire the answers right off.

### And, again, the key here is repetition. Better to teach five shortcuts and repeat them three weeks in a row during your training ses- sions than to teach five new shortcuts every week and have none of them stick. 

Now let's introduce the most powerful training you can possibly con- duct in any company or department.
### Workshop TrainingWorkshops are a powerful way to facilitate training, improve skills, and implement new procedures. This method is so effective for improv- ing any company, department, issue, or skill that we have devoted an en- tire chapter to it. 

If you take the time to sharpen skills and improve knowledge in every possible area, your company will start to run better, smarter, and faster- like a finely tuned sales machine.

*With consistent training every week in every area of your company, you can put higher and higher standards into place and raise the bar of performance for your entire staff. If you really want to become the Ultimate Sales Machine, training is an absolute must at every level, no matter how large or how small you might be.*

## Chapter 3: Processes
The best way to build the Ultimate Sales Machine and to keep it running as smoothly as possible is to hold regular, highly productive, workshop- style meetings dedicated to improving every aspect of your business.  all of the relevant people on fixing just one small part of the business. Together, you will brainstorm plans for how to improve this specific area, draft procedures to test, and ultimately create carved-in-stone company policies that everyone will be trained to follow. This constant attention to what I call the /“three Ps"-planning, procedures, and policies/-is essential if you want to easily and quickly grow your business into the Ultimate Sales Machine.

*A company that thinks like a small company remains small. A company, even a one-person army, that thinks and acts like a big company is going to grow faster, smarter, and better.*

Large companies typically already have training and procedure manuals, but they don't always go deep enough. Far too much is left up to individ- ual interpretation. *For example, I've never seen any company, short of those that have had my training, that has well-planned and -executed follow-up procedures after a sales call.* That is almost always left to the individual salesperson. When you do that, the quality of follow-up is going to vary widely.

It is essential that you schedule at least one hour a week to work on the three Ps. In the words of my good friend Michael Gerber (author of E-Myth), this is working on the business, not just in the business.

### Workshops
Workshops are an excellent method of focusing your mind and everyone else's on solutions and improvements within your organization. Work- shopping means that instead of you talking and your staff listening, all of you get to work together on a problem, developing the ideas and insights to propel the company forward. 

*Step-by-Step to an Outstanding Workshop*
1. The first thing you need to do is schedule your weekly meetings with your staff. 
2. Next, you need to decide what you are going to work on in your first meeting. You may have an obvious thorn in your side-like the lack of good time management practices or an ineffective referral program- that you will want to work on right away.
3. Taking Action on Workshop Ideas: As a result of your first workshop, you will have a list of things you need to work on to improve your business. In a moment I will show you how to prioritize the idea list into a master list you will use in planning future workshops. As you do these workshops, many things will surface that are easy to fix, create, or improve. But other things will surface that are worthy of sustained attention, as they are going to take time to fix. Right there on the spot, the boss can assign to-do's for specific people to "own" and get accomplished before the next meeting. 
4. As the workshops are creating procedures and policies to solve problems, the leader of the workshop puts out a postworkshop memo that says: "This week's workshop solved the problem of customer service inconsistencies. Here are the nine things you can do when a customer is unhappy." That memo goes into a "procedure binder" and that becomes a training manual for new people. Each memo is a page or two and so, at the end of the year, you will have 50 to 100 pages that document an entire year's worth of workshops. 


### This simple workshop is the first thing I do as an outside consultant when I go in to improve a company. For many of them, it has opened the door to creating lasting positive change. 

Imagine if you planned, tested, and established policies for every step of the sales process, from prospecting to cold calling to initiating interaction with customers to rapport building and right on through to every detail of follow-up. When a new salesperson comes in-Wham!- there in one place is the collective input, learning curve, and intelligence of all the salespeople, spelling out "best practices" for every step of the sales process. How much faster can the new salesperson enter the game of selling? And how much better is that salesperson going to be if you had this kind of training in the first few days? With a training tool like that, pretty soon you'll be able to hire 50 people in one week and tum around and do it again the next week.

## Continuing Workshops*Step 1:* Appoint the person to lead the group.
*Step 2:* On a whiteboard, write down the focus question: 'What is something else we can offer our buyer at the point of sale?"
*Step 3:* Now have participants in the group write down on their own pad every single idea that comes to them. 
*Step 4:* Now the leader of this exercise will ask participants to give their ideas. The leader will write them down on the whiteboard, summa- rizing them as he or she goes.*Step 5:* Prioritize. Now organize a vote to decide which ideas would work best. 
*Step 6:* The leader of the group will then ask each person to give his or her choices. At the end of the exercise, you'll have some clear winners; as you can see, 1 and 3 got the most votes.*Step 7:* Implementation: There are 10 steps to implement any new concept for any company. We're going to spell those out shortly.Once you see what you can accomplish with workshops, you will no doubt be hungry for more. Do them every week, and in a year you'll be an entirely different organization with dramatic improvements in every area of your business. Just stop everything, once per week for an hour, to fix all the things in your business that aren't the way you would like them or to add new improvements to strengthen your business or your profits.

### Example
So I get the owner on the phone: "I have a great idea for you. You should sell pads." He says, "We do." I tell him, "No, you don't, actually," and I play him the recording. The owner brings the salesperson in and asks her why she didn't offer to sell this old woman a pad. The salesper- son says, "I didn't want to seem too pushy."

We gathered all of the salespeople in a workshop and asked them, "What would you say is the best method for offering every client every service every time?" One suggested we put the six services they offer right on the order form. As they're talking to the client, they would be able to check off all six things on the order form to show they offered them. This was a great suggestion, so we decided to test it and implement it as a procedure for the company. We followed 10 Simple steps and, after several months of pigheaded discipline and hard work, we had it so that every salesperson offered every service to every customer every time.

## 10 steps to Implement Any New policy
1. Get Everyone to Feel the Pain: To create real change in any organization, you have to help everyone, including yourself, to define, outline, and intensifY the pain of not fixing the problem. When people start to think about their problems, they put themselves in the mood to learn, and that's the mood you want them to be in to get profound results.
2. Hold a Workshop to Generate Solutions: We've already covered this. If you are in a management position or are the CEO, you only have to bring with you to this workshop questions and your judgment. Whatever the problem, your staff deals with it every day. They will have many ideas on how to solve it.
3. Develop a "Conceptual Solution or procedure”: You've isolated what you want to work on (offering the up-sell every time) and you have a plan for what procedures you will follow to do this. You might even have scripts, outlines, and cheat sheets. In the case of the carpet company, putting the list of services on the order form was the conceptual solution. We say each solution or procedure is "concep- tual" until it is "proven" by you and your staff. In this case it is cut-and- dry, but other solutions you attempt may not be so Simple. These more complex solutions will need to be worked on in this phase of your implementation.
4. Leader or TOp Talent personally Performs Procedure or Task: Ifyou're a smaller company, often the CEO or leader ofthe company can personally test and perfect the procedure. The leader has the biggest picture of how everything fits together in the company or department, but he or she often leaves the details to others. Hands-on involvement at every level enables the leader to create the three Ps with certainty. When Scott Hallman was building his company to be Inc. magazine's .59th-fastest-growing company, he personally tested every procedure.
5.  Set a Deadline for Testing the Conceptual Procedure: Set a deadline so you know that if you aren't seeing results in a cer- tain amount of time, you need to go back to the workshop whiteboard and look at additional options. 
6. Document Step-by-Step Procedure or Process: You want this to be a repeatable process, so spell it out. Write out your scripts, procedures, activities, and the results you expect to achieve. Make it so 50 new hires could come in today and everything would be clear to them if they followed your three Ps manual. Even if your com- pany or department is small, you need to put these procedures in place
7. Have Show-and-Tell and Role Playing: Take your documented steps and work with your staff to test and im- plement them. Show-and-tell and role playing offer the best methods of gaining experience before you put the process into the field. If it's a telephone procedure, demonstrate it or record your high-level talent doing the procedure so your staff can actually hear how it works. Role-play and workshop every possible scenario. Work over your staff, forc- ing them to approach each scenario exactly as you would have them do it. (They learned that CEOs of large companies are great visionaries and can be engaged if you have a great promise for their future. )
8. Have Another Workshop on How to Improve: You're deep into implementing this procedure. If there are any weak spots or areas to improve, your staff will know about them. With the carpet cleaning company, we did many workshops with the staff, asking them how to best implement this strategy. So if you're having trouble implementing something, ask your staff how to do it better. People like to be asked their opinion. Then when they give it, they'll have a greater buy-in when you actually take advantage of the ideas they suggest. Make them work at it and perfect it in concept and in practice before you roll it out.
9. Monitor the Procedure Directly: In the case of the carpet cleaning up-sell, the owner of the company recorded the reps so I could hear the actual conversations. We corrected and monitored weekly. Some companies have people test something and then report back a month later. That's crazy. You need to monitor weekly. Or, if it's really important, monitor it every day so you can be sure that your staff is doing it properly and that it is bringing about the desired re- sults. No matter how well you spell it all out, some people will still miss some things. Monitor. Correct. Monitor....
10. Measure and Reward the outcome: You must measure your results intently. People respect what you in- spect. In step 3, you documented your expected results. Now you have to monitor to make sure everything is being done correctly to achieve those results. Rewarding comes last, after the bugs are out, but it is criti- cal. It is important that you set very specific criteria for rewarding your team. 

*Make a big deal out of the reward process. I learned this in my first job when I was 19 years old. The CEO would come into the company and give $100 to the top producer, $100 if you met your quota, and $100 to the ones who had the most add-on sales (lamps, end tables, etc.). You had the potential to earn three $100 bills. Not only that, but the CEO would shake your hand and make a big deal out of it. You will find that people will work even harder for the recognition than they will for the money. But, no matter how rich you are, a $100 bill is nice.*

# Chapter 4: Strategy
*A tactic* is a method or technique used to achieve an immediate or short-term gain. You run ads or send direct mail pieces to get leads. You go on a sales call to make a sale. You attend trade shows to meet with potential buyers and get more leads. These are examples of tactics.

*A strategy* is a carefully defined and detailed plan to achieve a long- term goal. In business, a strategy is the overall impact, the ultimate posi- tion you would like to achieve in the market. To think like a brilliant strategist, you will design and combine your tactics with the long-term strategy in mind.

*Now let's talk about the top 1 percent.* The executive who thinks both tactically and strategically can develop the big ideas and the big strategies and also use discipline and determination to see those brilliant strategies implemented at the tactical level. 
In store 2, of course, they try to sell you a couch, but the management constantly trains the salespeople to sell the store. "First time in our store? Well, let me tell you about it." And while the salespeople are on their way to the couches, they pitch the heck out of that store. They tell you about the history, the owner's devotion to service, why they have lower prices than their competitors, how well trained they are on furniture construction, and how that benefits you as the consumer. *The purpose of this buyer education is to create brand loyalty.*

I call this the science of setting the market's buying criteria. Basically it means that every buyer can be taught how to be a better buyer of your type of product or service. Using the carpet cleaning example, the buyer calls in with loose or few buying criteria at all. The salesperson then re- sets the buying criteria by educating that consumer about the EPA stud- ies on the importance of clean carpets to the quality of the air and life in your home. You can do this for your company with profound results. To further explain, let me introduce you to a powerful concept that really tunes up the strategist in all of us:

## The Stadium Pitch
Imagine that I could put you on stage in a giant stadium where the entire audience is composed of your most perfect prospects, giving you the opportunity to present to them all at once. I give speeches all over the world where I ask this question. Usually about three to six people raise their hands (out of 1,000 in the audience). When I drill down with the few who raise their hands, I find that they are usually not ready, but sometimes I find someone who is ready. They've got a killer stadium pitch and it's expertly tuned. I compliment them, saying, "Wow, you are really prepared." The response comes back: "Thank you for the compliment, but I have to thank you because I got one of your training products years ago." 

The audience will laugh, thinking the person has to be working for me, but, boy, does it make a point about the strategist. As you will soon see, a well-prepared stadium pitch will enable you to attract a lot more prospects and close a higher percentage of tire kickers into actual buyers.

### The stadium pitch example
Twenty years of research has shown me that there's always a very small percentage of folks "bUying now." Three percent. I gave a lecture recently in front of 1,200 CEOs and said: "Let me prove this to you. How many people in the audience are in the market for a car right now?" About 30 people raised their hands. "How about tires?" A different 30 raised their hands. "How about furniture?" Thirty hands up. "How about home improvements?" Yet another 30 hands. "Office eqUipment?" You see my point. About 3 percent of potential buyers at any given time are buying now. Right now. That percentage drives all commerce.

My research further concludes that 7 percent of the population is open to the idea of buying. This is the percentage who may be dissatisfied with their current item or provider and are not opposed to change, but who may not yet be "buying now." The remaining 90 percent fall into one of three equal categories. The top third are what I call "not thinking about it." They are not against it, not for it, but just "not thinking about it." So if you sell office equipment and you ran an ad, this 30 percent would not respond because they're just not thinking about office equipment right now.

The next third are what I call "think they're not interested." So at first pass, they are not neutral like the first third. They would reply, "I don't think I'm interested in office equipment." And then the final third are what I call "definitely not interested." These folks are happy with what they have or just simply know they don't need it. They may have a 10-year-old copier, but if it's not broken, why fix it?

![](The%20ultimate%20sales%20machine%20by%20Chet%20Holmes/The%20ultimate%20sales%20machine%20by%20Chet%20Holmes/Screen%20Shot%202017-08-29%20at%2016.05.22.png)

So now let's rethink that stadium title. What could you say that would keep virtually everyone in their seats? This is important because whatever that title is that would get all those potential buyers to stay and hear more is the same approach to use in your advertising, direct mail, or Web site. What can you write as your stadium pitch title or ad, for that matter, that would appeal to the entire pyramid of potential buyers?

/Let's imagine that you sell office equipment. It's your turn to give your speech and the audience is full of CFOs. If you're a little strategic, you might go with something like "The Five Ways Our Office Equipment Can Benefit You." Again, an approach like this appeals only to those who are "buying now," and possibly those who are "open to it," but pretty much 90 percent of your audience is leaving. So what title would have a broader appeal? How about "The Five Ways You're Wasting Money in Your Operations and Administration"? I'm not saying this is going to rivet the executives to their chairs, but they're not leaving either. They'll stay to hear a little more. This is also true for an ad with that headline. It's definitely going to appeal to the top two tiers, but it also appeals to everyone in that stadium./ *Everyone is interested in saving money in their operations and administration costs. Certainly every CFO is interested in that, so they'll stay in the stadium. And if everything that follows has some substance to it, you've now taken your marketing and selling activity to an entirely new level.*

The hardest thing we need to do today is grab the attention of potential buyers and keep their attention long enough to help them buy your product. This approach of offering some education of value to them gives you a significant opportunity to attract more buyers and build more credibility. *I call this "education-based marketing,”* and here's a line you should write down: you will attract way more buyers if you are offering to teach them something of value to them than you will ever attract by simply trying to sell them your product or service.

As another example, I had a merchant services company as a client. They primarily target retail stores. So in the stadium pitch scenario, their audience are retail store owners. If they walk out there and start off with, ''I'm going to show you why our merchant services are better than any- one else's," the 90 percent are leaving since they are not in the market for merchant services right now. So what could you say to keep every retailer in the stadium to hear a little more? Here's a great title: "The Five Reasons All Retailers Fail." The tactical executive reading this is al- ready saying, "But if all I really want to do is sell merchant services, then why would I bother with all this?

### Here's the answer:
1. Offering an education that helps the buyer is going to get more buyer interest.
2. If the information is actually good and useful, it automatically re- positions you in the mind of the buyer as much more of an expert than all your competitors. (You're teaching them things about their own business that they might not know.)
3. If you think and plan strategically, you will find a way to weave that information in such a way that ultimately sells your services far better than you could ever sell them by simply flat-out pitch- ing your product. Examples will follow.

## Case Study: More on Education-Based Marketing
I was brought in as a sales expert. I audited four of the company's more troubled newspapers and presented my strategy for turning around advertising sales. 

Before I instituted anything the company model was purely tactical. It owned more than 100 community daily newspapers in midsize cities. An ad salesperson would call up a prospective advertiser and say, "Hi. I'm with XYZ Gazette and we'd love to come and talk to you about your advertising." If the prospect was not "buying now," this was a very short conversation: "No thanks. I'm not interested."

REP: Hi. I'm with XYZ Gazette. We have a new program to teach business owners like you how to be more successful. Have you heard about this program?
PROSPECT: No, I haven't.
REP: Well, since we rely on the success of local commerce, as do youand everyone else in this community, we feel it's our obligation to make sure local businesses are as successful as possible. So we've actually underwritten the cost of an educational program that shows you the five most common reasons that businesses fail. It also shows the seven ways to become the most popular [name the type of business here: hair salon, restaurant, etc.] in the community. In the next few weeks, we're going to be showing this to every other [name the type of competitor here] in the community and thought you might want to make sure you're learning the same things they're learning. Would you be interested in being more successful in your business and guarding yourself against the types of things that put [your type of business] out of business?
PROSPECT: Well, duh. Of course, I would.
REP: Great. Here's what we do. I'm one of the speakers who put onthis program. [Do not call your salespeople salespeople.] I'm going to be going around to all the [type of business] over the next few weeks and presenting this information. The content takes about 38 minutes to cover and then usually you'll have some questions, so most of these sessions last about an hour. Since this is a community program, we even come to you. You don't have to travel. But we only do these at a time when we won't be disturbed, so we can get in and out quickly. What's a time when you can sit and have a good educational experience without being interrupted?PROSPECT: Well, we start at nine and then all hell breaks loose around here-so either at eight or after five.
REP: We have another program where we buy you lunch. We call it a "lunch-and-Iearn." You have to eat anyway, so you might as well learn something while you're eating. In this case you come to a restaurant. We rent out a room. You get to sit with several other business owners, have a nice lunch, and get a terrific education on how to ensure the success of your business. Which would you rather do? Have us come to you during off-hours or attend our lunch-and-Iearn?PROSPECT: The free lunch sounds good.
REP: Great. We're doing three of those this week. We have one todayat noon at [restaurant name]. Then there is one on Wednesdayand one on Friday. Which day works best for you?
PROSPECT: Can't do it today, but Wednesday looks good.REP: Great. I'll put you down for Wednesday. Now this is a very ex-pensive program for us, but there's no cost to you. Like I said, we thrive if our local community thrives. So we have only one condition for you attending. You've agreed to attend on Wednesday. When we fill up that day, we will start to turn people away who want to attend. So once you commit, all we ask is the professional courtesy that you attend or at least give us 24 hours notice to fill your seat if you can't come. Does that seem fair?PROSPECT: Sure.REP: Great. Write my phone number on your calendar so if you needto reschedule, you'll have it handy. 
*END SCRIPT.*

Now the business owners gather to see the information. Here is the basic content. The session begins with overall data on businesses: how many businesses there are in the United States, how many start each year, the failure rate of business, and so on-just good general information of interest to any business owner. This data is eye-opening because it shows that 96 percent of all businesses fail within 10 years, with 80 percent failing within the first two years.
From there the session goes on to show five common reasons why businesses fail. This data is very easy to gather and you can tailor it to your needs. For example, according to Entrepreneur magazine, the top reasons for failure include bad customer relations, bad budgeting, lack of staff training, failure to anticipate market trends, and poor and inconsistent marketing.

When we get to the last-poor and inconsistent marketing-we go into some core ways to market. Again, not hard to assemble. The last section of this educational program teaches that "advertising" is one of the best ways to get customers. And guess what. There are studies that show this. There is no need to make up anything. The section on advertising compares the various ways to advertise (the yellow pages, radio, TV, direct mail, etc.), brilliantly showing why each has its drawbacks to an advertiser-except, of course, newspapers. 
To be very clear, everything until this point is educational. This is not a veiled sales pitch. All the data is legitimate and so good that people take notes. But then, of course, the last part goes into "the power of newspapers." We found that newspaper readers tend to be more educated than the average consumer. Newspapers are a major driver of commerce in their communities. The presentation is very compelling.In my experience with my newspaper company client, by the end of the session, everyone who saw the orientation wanted to advertise in the newspaper. Noone felt sold. They felt educated. Why? Because when you sell, you break rapport, but when you educate, you build it.

### Let's look at all the strategic objectives accomplished by education- based marketing:
* It made it a lot easier to get appointments.
* It enabled you to get in to see just about anyone-including the 90 percent who were not buying now.
* Since the information was so good, it established the salesperson as an expert rather than merely a salesperson.
* Since the information was so good, it gave credibility to thesalesperson.
* When you begin any meeting with real data and hard facts, the sales material at the end of the meeting has a lot more credibility.
* Because we have control over the material covered, it artfully unseats every type of competitor we have. For newspapers, this would be the yellow pages, TV, radio, and so on.
* It created brand loyalty.
* If someone gives you something of value, you want to give back.People who saw this orientation wanted to advertise, if only to honor the devotion of the newspaper that prOvided such useful information.
* Part of the education taught the importance of consistency in your advertising. This addressed another strategic problem the newspapers were having. Folks would try advertising once and, if it didn't yield results immediately, they would pull out. This pro- gram taught that it takes time to build a presence in the eye of the community.
* It made people feel that advertising in the community newspaper was almost a moral obligation to support your community. "The more support we have, the more programs like this we can bring to the community."
* The expert and strategically deSigned presentation made selling idiot-proof for the salespeople. The sales reps went around to business owners with a three-ring presentation binder that stood up on the desk. They flipped through the panels and showed the information to all the prospects. I recommend using PowerPoint whenever possible, but the point is that every rep had the same material to present.
* The presentation says everything the top management would want every prospect to hear and know. Most sales organizations leave 90 percent of the sales process up to the rep.
* It made the reps smarter. Even if some reps weren't using the ex- act material provided, it gave them insights on business success that they never had before. This automatically made them more consultative in their selling.

### Implementing a comprehensive program like this, however, can elevate you to a level where virtually no one can compete with you.

So this newspaper company might go from a Madison Avenue-style unique selling proposition of "reaching more people in the community daily than any other media source" to an ultimate strategic position of "helping businesses and consumers in our market live better lives." This is an example of going from being focused on yourself to being focused on your buyer. In the more strategic USP I give, we focus not only on the advertisers but also on the readers. This is a broader, more outwardly focused USP.

### Why I Also Call a Stadium Pitch a Core story
I refer to the stadium pitch as your core story because, if it's done properly, this core story will provide data that will make all your marketing work harder. The data becomes the core of all your marketing. The data sets the buying criteria in your favor.For example, I'm working with a company now that sells incentives to other businesses. These are used by its clients to increase brand loyalty, motivate more purchasing, as well as increase employee retention and performance. The salespeople of every other company in this field will present you with all the incentives you would ever care to see. My client offers a stunning education on "Four Ways to Increase Profits, Performance, and Sales." During this magnificent education, the prospect learns a ton of information about all these areas. The end result is that the prospect becomes much more educated about the power and use of incentives in the running of his or her business. Prior to seeing this data, the prospect's buying criteria may be extremely loose and uninformed. After seeing this data, the client is highly educated and motivated not only on why and how to use incentives but also on my client's company in particular. This company is perceived as more educated and sophisticated than any of its competitors. So the market's bUying criteria shift in favor of the expert every single time.*You should have this goal for your product or service. What informa- tion will help set the buying criteria in your favor? No matter what you sell, data makes your information work harder. Also, it needs to be said that the more complex your product or service, the better the opportu- nity to appear as an expert.*

*Important Point*If you come from the place of truly wanting to serve your buyer, then being a market expert-not just a product expert-means being more knowledgeable than any of your competitors. This is easy to do as most of your competitors will be more concerned about selling product than about positioning themselves as experts. In every case where I have personally run companies using these strategies or helped clients do the same, we have literally slaughtered our competitors. Even after they see what we are doing, they cannot grasp it. Truly, building a core story or stadium pitch is working smarter, not harder. The one who gives the market the most and best information will always slaughter the one who just wants to sell products or services.

Here's the key to choosing which data to include: market data is way more motivational than product data. Most people think that a shoe is a shoe (product data), but when you learn that your feet connect to every organ in your body, that's market data. It makes your choice of shoe much more important. So think about what market data is there that makes your products or services much more important.

The mass merchants were putting the calendars in the stationery department. They weren't moving nearly as many calendars per rack or spin?er. By showing this data to more and more stores, my client in- creased sales 20 percent in a single year whereas the company had not had an increase in sales for four years prior to using this market data to motivate better positioning of the calendars.*And it goes on and on. No matter who you are or what you sell, you need to take the time to collect market data and build your core story or your stadium pitch.*

## The smoking Gun
In the legal market, the term smoking gun refers to that piece of evidence that makes it so your opponent cannot win. You've found the smoking gun that makes the other party guilty. It's the same with research. There's always that smoking gun that positions you above everyone else. The fact that art actually facilitates healing and that calendars sell like crazy when you put them at the register are both smoking guns. I can list hundreds of examples and I can tell you this for sure: there's always a smoking gun. Always.

I had a client who sold lawn care services, and every year some of his workers would break off on their own and steal away his clients by offering to do the same work they were already doing for less: "Just pay me personally instead of my company." The research team turned up a case in which the state of New York actually sued a homeowner, forcing that homeowner to pay worker's compensation on the lawn care person who hurt himself while working on the homeowner's lawn. Take that piece of data to a customer who's switching for $5 less per month and ask them: "Are you sure that your new lawn care person has worker's compensation insurance? Because if he doesn't and he gets hurt on your property, you could actually be responsible for his worker's compensation payments for as long as he's injured." This is definitely a smoking gun-a single fact that makes it unlikely that any client would want to switch to a single worker who didn't have all the proper licensing and insurance.
To get the most powerful market data and to uncover the smoking gun, the trick is to look at things over time. That's where you'll find the big breakthroughs. I had a client who deliberately avoided selling his products through the big mass merchants like Wal-Mart. The company was doing all its sales through gift shops. A little research revealed that there were 36,000 gift shops. That looked like a big number until you looked at how many gift shops there had been in 1985. There were 96,000! That means 60,000 gift shops had gone out of business, while Wal-Mart was adding more locations every day. That made the client change strategy in a hurry. Go look at data over time. It's amazing.

# Chapter 5: Hiring
This chapter will reveal 20 years of secrets in finding, interviewing,testing, motivating, compensating, and managing superstar employees.

Based on that, we put an ad in the paper using the highest possible figure as bait. It's amazing how so many companies put the average income a salesperson can make in their ads. That's how you get average salespeople. Put the highest possible number that a top person can make in your ads. 
## What Makes a Superstar?The type of people I'm talking about are those you can put in a bad situ- ation with poor tools, no training, and bad resources and still, within a few months, they begin to outperform your best people.

*Personality profiling is the key to finding superstars.*Just as an example, let's focus on one of the most developed, validated, and popular methods, DISC personality profile.

*Dominance* is a personality trait that has to do with the strength of your ego. Strong ego is crucial in sales because it means you will have the drive and personal ambition to close as many sales as possible and the armor to not take repeated and even harsh rejections personally. 
*Influence* has to do with how you interact in social situations and how well and how much you communicate. High-influence people love people. They are naturally empathetic, easily putting themselves in other people's positions and understanding their points of view.
*Steadiness* is all about how patient, persistent, and thoughtful you are. High-steadiness people are deliberate in their actions and decisions. They work steadily and cohesively with others, but are most happy be- hind the scenes. They are good listeners and have the ability to gain sup- port from others. Low-steadiness people are incessant multitaskers. They move fast and initiate action.*Compliance* has to do with how you relate to structure and organiza- tion. High-compliance people always plan ahead. They are cautious in their actions and decisions and they work well alone. They like organization and structure, and they work accurately and precisely. Low-compliance people think of the big picture and are not as cautious in their actions. They will wing it more than a high-compliance person. They see gray areas and are more general and independent in their thinking.

### The recipe for a superstar is not just a high level of one trait. It is a combination of different intensities of each trait. However, if your candidate's personality combines high influence with high dominance, you've found your sales superstar. Further, high dominance may not be the ideal characteristic for a superstar receptionist or administrative assistant or anyone who needs to be more team-oriented. But for sales it's a perfect fit. 

PS: About half of the salespeople I've worked with over the years gave up after a single rejection. They would call a client, the client would say no, and the salesperson would never call that person back. Very few, per- haps only 4 percent to 5 percent, keep trying after four rejections. Yet, as you learned in the previous chapter, I've found that it takes about 8.4 rejections to get a meeting. And what makes the difference between people who will face that rejection one time and quit or 40 times and never quit is determined purely by the strength of their ego.

### Guidelines to Hiring Superstars
*SUPERSTARS ONLY $50K to $300K*
/Don't even call unless you are an overachiever and can prove it. Come build an empire within our fine, progressive company. We are in the XYZ industry, but we don't hire backgrounds. We hire top producers. If you're average, you can earn $50K with us. If you are a star, you can earn $300K plus. Young or old, if you have the stuff, we'll know. Contact us at …/
*Notice this ad does not request a resume. It does not ask for a minimum number of years of experience.*

### Age and Background Are Not Relevant 
It's all about personality profile. I've hired 24-year-olds who have outsold 20-year veterans. One of my greatest finds came from a stereo store. Here was an awesome salesperson whom I never would have even noticed if I didn't know about personality profiling. I saw immediately that he had the stuff of superstars, so I recruited him out of the stereo store and set him on a path that ultimately made him a millionaire. *The point is to be on the lookout for those superstars everywhere you go.*

### The Prescreen-the Method You won't Find in Any Human Resources Manual
Here's how to spot flaws in salespeople before you even interview them. The first thing you do to anyone who applies for a job in your company is to reject them, telling them why you don't think they can do the job. It's not that you don't want to hire the person. It's that you're look- ing for the unique personality profile that becomes more effective in the face of adversity. This is the most important lesson I can offer for hiring people. If you reject candidates and they quickly crumble and go away, you see right then and there, before you hire them, what they are made out of. A superstar will start to question your reasoning-and may even tell you that you are wrong. It's a very powerful exercise in determining people's strength.

People who have a strong ego but don't naturally bond with or relate well to others might be ideal. They will care more about closing the sale than anything else. These people do not make good team players, but you can't have it all. They will produce. So you have to decide what's more important-a lot of nice team players or a lot of sales. *Again, such a candidate is not ideal for sales where you need to build a bond with clients and keep them buying.*

### Three steps to Interviewing Superstars
Now that you've narrowed down the applicant pool, you're ready to interview the top candidates. Here's a three-part interview structure de- signed to draw out the superstars: relax, probe, attack.
*Relax*Once candidates talk their way in for an interview, begin by giving them every opportunity to show their best side. Help them relax. You should be friendly and be a great listener. 

*Probe*The purpose of this portion of the interview is to get to know the per- son. Before you begin, you must tell prospects that they don't have to answer any questions they don't want to answer. Explain to them that your company hires based upon personality profile rather than back- ground and ask them directly, "Do you agree that this is more perti- nent?" When they answer yes, you say that you'd like to find out what shaped them, so you're going to start with their childhood. Additionally, this portion of the interview tests the level of their em- pathy. If they become stiff during this section, you don't have a natural bonder. Tell them that you are going to ask questions about their mother and father as well as questions about how they grew up. If they become uncomfortable, you don't have a superstar. Superstars like to bond with others. *Probing the candidate's childhood is crucial because self-confidence is often shaped very early in life, so you want to find out if the candidate’s. background contributed to building up self-esteem.* 

### My philosophy is that the sales environment should be structured where the strong survive and thrive and the weak go do something else. This is a race and you need champions. Put the people who aren't sales superstars in customer service.

*Attack*Now we are at the end of the interview. You're probed deeply. You may sense that you've found a high achiever, but you'll often be surprised at what happens when you "attack." Try saying something such as, "You seem like a nice person, but I only have one opening. I need a real super- star. While I'm sure you would do well in many endeavors, this is a very competitive industry and I doubt your particular skills and personality will hold up in this position. To be truthful, I don't get the impression you're really a superstar."

*Rewarding Your superstar*
The last aspect of hiring top talent is to create a performance-based rela- tionship with little or no base pay. There are countless ways to do this. Let me give you an example. I had a client who paid $9 per hour plus commission. He was even putting this in his ads for new salespeople. This base pay is not much-certainly not enough of a reward to attract superstars-but his commission structure was so good that his top pro- ducer was earning $92,000 per year.

Do you want to attract the kind of person who will be like your top producer or do you want to attract $9-per-hour-type talent?" We put, "Can earn as high as $100K if you are a star," right in his ad. This dramatically changed the type of person he started to attract.

*How Even One-Person Armies Can Hire Top Talent*
ME: What's a dream project for you?HIM: An identity package for an emerging and well-funded start-up orgrowing company.ME: How much would a gig like that get you?HIM: The right project, $25,000.ME: And how much of that are you willing to give away every day toget a project like that?HIM: I could give 20 percent and still be happy.ME: That's $5,000.HIM: Right.ME: And how many of those could you handle per month?HIM: Probably four per month.ME: SO $5,000 times four projects per month is $20,000. Put that inthe newspaper and see what kind of talent you pull.

As long as you're willing to pay, even just on performance, you might be shocked to learn that there's someone perfect who will build your company for you as long as you share the wealth as she does so.

## How to Manage a Superstar
The key to keeping superstars is to never say no to them. Instead, re- direct their energy or give them a few hurdles to jump in order to get what they want. 
SUPERSTAR: This promo piece is terrible. We should have a better one. YOU: I designed the one you're criticizing, but great! Let's see whatyou can come up with.

There is no need to react or get defensive. Just direct their energy, challenge them, and see what they create. The more you challenge superstars, the more you encourage them to overachieve. But don't forget to compliment them when they meet and exceed your challenge.

SUPERSTAR: I could definitely increase sales. 
YOU: I'll believe it when I see it. Talk is cheap.

We based the performance around the best framer and made it so everyone could earn more money if they performed like him. Can you structure income around performance, no matter what the position? Today, it's all about performance.

*It takes time and persistence to create a superstar team. Resist feel- ing put off if your first hire or even your first few hires don't work out.*
Put some top-producing talent in the company and watch it grow.

# Chapter 6: The Best Buyers*Copy:* The following strategy has probably helped more companies double their sales faster than any other single concept. 

In a sentence: there's always a smaller number of "best buyers" than there are all buyers. That means that marketing to them is cheaper than marketing to all buyers. A direct mail effort to 100 "best buyers" is obviously less expensive to mar- ket than a direct-mail effort to an entire audience of 10,000 "all buyers." 

Best buyers buy more, buy faster, and buy more often than other buyers. These are your ideal clients. No matter what else you are doing, you should have additional effort to capture them. I call this strategy the Dream 100 effort. It is your program for targeting your 100 (or whatever number is appropriate) dream clients constantly and relentlessly until they buy your product or service. The goal of the Dream 100 is to take your ideal buyers from I’ve never heard of this company" to "What is this company I keep hearing about?" to "I think I've heard of that company" to "Yes, I've heard of that company" to "Yes, I do business with that company."

### Business-to-Business Sales
We designed a core story educational seminar: "The Five Most Dangerous Trends Facing Law Firms." We called the managing directors of the top 50 law firms to offer the free education.

* First, note how we used fear as a motivator. It's far easier to get in to see top executives if there are "dangerous trends" facing them than if you offer some currently unrealized benefit.
* Also, the term social proof was heavily at play here. That means, "When others are doing it, it's okay for me to do it, too." Or to put that in a business context, "When best buyers buy, other best buyers buy faster."
* I have a rule about selling: never lie. Make sure you're telling the truth. By wording our telephone approach carefully, we were telling the truth, but the impression we gave was that it was already happening.
* From a structural standpoint, when you use a selling approach like this, you have to make sure that your first objective is to truly serve the buyer. That "stadium pitch" or "core story" was rock solid and full of terrific and useful data about law firms and their challenges.

The first thing we did was send out a Rubik's Cube to those 508 com- panies. In the accompanying note we said: "Puzzled about how to double or triple employee productivity? We guarantee to find you 12 ways to reduce costs or increase productivity or we'll give you a $5,000 gift for your trouble." This time they got only one response. It just so happened that that one response was from a company with 355 employees. This would be the biggest sale in the client's history.

We sent the dream companies a little gift with a clever tie-in every other week for the entire five months I worked with this client. When I left them, they had nine times more business in play than they had done in the previous year. If this client was wise, it would have continued to hammer those 508 large companies in its area. Over time, whenever any of them need a computer system, who do you think they are going to call first?

### If you continue to market to someone with great vigor, they will absolutely get to know who you are. If they tell you no again and again and you keep marketing and selling to them, here is what will happen: they will go from not knowing who you are to knowing exactly who you are to maybe even being annoyed that you won't go away to starting to respect you because no one has ever marketed to them with such force to even feeling obligated to give you some business. Yes, obligated. If someone keeps coming after you again and again and again, even if you are not interested in that person, you start to feel like you want to give something back. I've used this approach in hundreds of cases, especially for myself. I've gotten 60 of the Fortune 500 as clients through the pigheaded de- termination I'm recommending for you.
I decided that I wanted Wells Fargo Bank as a client and called the chairman and CEO of the company. To my utter shock, he called me right back 10 minutes later. Here I was expecting my usual three to six months of hard labor, and the man just called me right back. He tried to turn me down for a meeting about four or five times on that phone call, but I persisted until he finally said, "How's tomorrow at 3:00?" I sputtered and took the meeting. On my way to the meeting, I stopped at three of their branches, looking to open a business checking account, and was able to report to him about my experience and how I thought I could improve it. I got the account. This is to say that you will be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to get 99 percent of your dream clients. There will be that 1 percent that take forever but even those can be had if you're committed.

*Hollywood Example*I bought the issue of Premiere magazine that lists "the 100 most powerful people in Hollywood." Gee, there it was, my Dream 100 list, and someone had already done the work for me. I called the CEOs of all the major studios, including Paramount, Dis- ney, Warner Bros., Universal, and Sony Pictures. Using the techniques we'll go over in Chapter Nine, I was able to get seven out of 11 of the big- gest CEOs in Hollywood on the telephone. 

Ultimately, LeAnn liked the project and we walked into Warner Bros., where they bought the screenplay from me. This certainly would never have happened if I had not first been completely systematic in getting the script into the hands of the most powerful people in Holly- wood. They were my Dream 100. While it would have been easy to get discouraged and give up after a few initial rejections, my experience showed me that with determination and discipline to keep targeting the most powerful potential buyers, I would get a deal for my movie. The Dream 100 effort strikes again! One of the lessons for you is to build that list, organize your approach, and never say die.

*Copy:* “I called the CEOs of all the major studios, including Paramount, Disney, Warner Bros., Universal, and Sony Pictures. Using the techniques we'll go over in Chapter Nine, I was able to get seven out of 11 of the big- gest CEOs in Hollywood on the telephone.“ (Over and over the whole text he writes that you get something special in chapter 9)

But while you're doing that, and for a lot less money, you could send a special direct mail effort to just the best neighbourhoods where the best buyers live. The secret is to do it continuously so that you build top-of-mind awareness among those best buyers.

*Copy:*If you sell to consumers, target the best neighborhoods with great consistency. And remember that you should be willing to do more to at- tract them than you'd do for everyday buyers. Give something away; make a lot of attractive offers to get them in the door. Once they are there, what can you do to keep them? *There is more coming up on this in other chapters to help you fully flesh out this strategy.*

*Dream affiliates* are another excellent growth strategy. Is there a com- pany that could partner with you to send you more business than you could handle? Jay Abraham taught me the strategy of affiliate marketing. Who sells to the exact buyer you want to reach but doesn't sell your type of product or service? Here's an "affiliate strategy" that I used to get hundreds of clients all at once. Harv Eker (author of Secrets of the Millionaire Mind) has training programs that are complementary to ours but not competitive. We cut a deal where we'd offer one ofhis programs as a bonus when people buy ours. Since most of our products are sold to business owners, Harv was only too happy to have us promote him to all our buyers. At the end of our seminars and Web seminars, right when we are going into our close, we put up three panels talking about Harv and how brilliant and valuable his programs are.

Affiliate marketing means you ride in on someone else's well- established relationship. This is far less expensive than trying to acquire a customer on your own. Dream affiliates can increase your sales dra- matically overnight; therefore, you can afford to share generously with them. We run radio ads every week to drive just 60 business owners to one of our ventures. When Jay Levinson wrote a strong endorsement letter to his list, we got 450 new leads in a single day.

The point is that affili- ate marketing is a much faster way to grow than traditional advertising, direct mail, or other forms of driving cold leads. That said, what does it take to get these ideal affiliates? Jay Abraham took two years, but he wasworth every phone call, letter, and approach.It may take you some time, but there is no market in the world thatyou can't penetrate if you're committed and willing to do something on a regular and consistent basis. Throughout my entire career in the trenches, I simply picked the clients I wanted and went after them with constant marketing. I "decided" that they would be clients and then just went after them until I got them.

### The Power of Referrals
The woman who sold us our house was so excel- lent that I have since referred her to three other people, whom she has helped as well. This book is not going to focus on referrals per se-they are so important, I should devote an entire chapter to them-but I do want to emphasize that you should have a specific strategic objective to gain referrals.

*Copy:* The Dream 100 strategy has doubled the sales of many clients and it can work for you. You just have to have the pigheaded discipline and determination to build a great Dream 100 program and stick to it like white on rice.

# Chapter 7: Marketing
If you build that stadium pitch or core story as outlined in Chapter Four, all of your marketing weapons will work more effectively and more as a united front. Here are what I call the Seven Musts of Marketing. Every company that wants to be number one in its industry or profession must deploy them:* Advertising* Direct mail* Corporate literature: brochures and promotional pieces* Public relations* Personal contact: salespeople and customer service* Market education: trade shows, speaking engagements, andeducation-based marketing (as described in Chapter Four)
* Internet: Web sites, email efforts, and affiliate marketing

In small companies, you may not be able to afford to do them all, so you have to pick and choose which weapons will get you the most impact for the least money.

But when they do, they all work more effectively as part of the same machine. I call this stacked marketing. It involves coordinating all of your marketing weapons rather than having varying and even conflicting messages from each separate weapon. *With stacked marketing, you develop a consistent message,* look, theme, and slogan that carries throughout all of your marketing efforts.

### Market data (being more motivational than product data) now dominates all his marketing weapons.

## Marketing weapon 1: Advertising
If you have the budget for it, advertising has the broadest reach and creates the most top-of-mind awareness. Every so often we'd find that one ad was pulling 10 times more response than other ads for similar products in the same magazine. Invariably, the best-pulling ads all followed a specific formula. 

There are four rules for creating high-response-generating advertising:

* *Rule 1 It Must Be Distinctive:* The first important thing about your ad is whether or not it attracts attention. The best response-generating ads catch the eye and hold it.  Another ad that stands out in my mind was for a graphic design firm. It was a shot of a herd of zebras and one of them had all different-colored stripes, like a roll of Life Savers-this, against a sea of black-and-white zebras. The headline that went with that ad was great, too: "In the corporate jungle, identity is everything." 
* *Rule 2. Capture Attention With a Screaming Headline:*  Back to print. The most effective ads have a headline that follows this important rule: "Tell me what you want to tell me in 3.2 seconds." The headline should give a benefit and focus on the prospect by using "you" or "your" instead of focusing on your self by using the word "we." It should communicate its message immediately and make you want to read on for more information.  Example: Or here's one that's even stronger: "How would you like to capture three times more clients and lock them in so securely that no one could take them away from you?" That would've pulled them more leads than they could've handled. Instead, they blew a million on what they called "image ads."
* *Rule 3. After Your Headline Hooks Them, Your Body Copy Has to Keep Them Reading:* First, the body copy must focus on your prospect, not on you. The biggest mistake most advertisers make is focusing on themselves. I'm working with a company that does a lot of advertising. Every ad its people send me to tune up is focused on them instead of the prospect. *Next*, each sentence should unfold the "story" you want to tell and make the prospect want to read on. Like the headline, the body copy should be benefit-oriented. Don't tell me what it is. Tell me why it is valuable.
* *Rule 4 Include a Call to Action:* A reason to act now is always great: "Call us now for a free report (only 100 left)." "The first 100 who respond receive a $XXX bonus." An- other discovery from our print-ad test that amazed me is that a coupon in the bottom right-hand comer of the ad actually increased response. It might be a little box that says, "Yes, send me more information," and then a few lines where prospects fill in their contact information.

## Other Advertising Insights
If you're on a budget, you can take an ad one time and use it in all your other activities, which adds credibility. We once took a one-time, full-page ad in Forbes with the condition that they give us 100 copies of the magazine for free. Next we included those 100 copies with a letter to 100 dream prospects with a Post-it Ragging the page with our full-page ad. The salespeople also got copies of the magazine so that they could Rip open the magazine and show prospects the full-page ad in Forbes. We then used the same ad at a trade show with a banner across the right comer that said, "as seen in Forbes."

### So let's talk about radio. I have two stories. Traditional wisdom, as taught by radio guru Dan O'Day, says that on the radio, since you only have 60 seconds, you should try to give one main message. 

Hi, I'm Chet Holmes. If you own a business, I'd like to help you dou- ble your sales in 12 months flat. We've doubled the sales of more companies than anyone else. We teach 12 concepts that will double sales in 12 months. Here's just one ofthem: Ifyou sell to consumers, there's a way to market to only the best neighborhoods, reduce your marketing costs, and increase the quality ofyour buyers dramatically. Or, ifyou sell to businesses, it's even easier to double sales. I doubled the sales of a company three years in a row for a well-known billion- aire by focusing on only 167 dream clients.

Movie TV spots should be like a minimovie, telling a story. And the better the hook in the story, the more interested consumers are going to be. The power of storytelling in advertising is not limited to movie companies. I recently saw a very clever ad for clothing that looked like a movie trailer. Tell a story that intrigues the imagination and you stand a better chance of people actually watching your commercial.

## Cable TelevisionToday, you can get your ads made for very little money. Mr. Tim paid $400 for his ad and the local cable company did everything for him. I know several local companies that have had spots created that look pretty darn good for under $1,000.

## Billboard Advertising
This is the final area of advertising. Obviously, everything I've already covered applies here. Billboards must be remarkably distinctive or they are a waste of money. They are not practical for direct response. In an area I drive through frequently, there is a billboard ad for a local mort- gage broker. When I called him to ask if he got response from it, he said that he did, but he wouldn't say how much. This made me think the response wasn't overwhelming, but he did say that it helped him close a lot of deals and to build his "brand" among real estate brokers he was trying to penetrate.

A little further down the road, another mortgage broker copied him, but made his billboard way too busy. He was trying to squeeze a TV commercial into a billboard. *The billboard must have one single message and it should be communicated visually.* Obviously, allover New York and Los Angeles billboards are used primarily for fashion, branding a specific designer. So there will be a sexy image and one word on the billboard.

## Marketing weapon 2: Direct Mail
Now, if you've done a good job with education-based marketing (Chap- ter Four), you can use it to make your direct mail much more powerful. Going back to the carpet cleaning company, it has created direct mail that shows a superimposed image of a dust mite with the words, "Five million of these can live in your living room carpets if you don't get professional cleaning." The dust mite is an ugly creature. It looks likes a creature from the movie Aliens, starring Sigourney Weaver. What market data did you gather for your stadium pitch that would make a good "wow" for your direct mail piece?

A successful direct mail campaign absolutely depends on how regular and consistent your mailings are.
	* First, use color as much as possible-either on the envelope itself or in the lettering on the outside of the envelope.
	* Second, put messages on the envelope. You've got to get the prospect to open the envelope. So a message on the outside-which should follow the above rules for writing a great ad headline-is a good way to go. *Make it benefit oriented and focused on the prospect.*
	* Third, think about the way you sort your own mail. Which item are you going to open first: something that looks like a greeting card or the bill from the phone company? I've seen many companies use greeting- card-, invitation-, or even wedding-announcement-style mailers to great effect. 
Countless books on direct mail are better sources of information, so I will limit my comments to using direct mail as a weapon for attacking your dream prospects. But don't forget that this weapon, when combined with other weapons, can be made much more effective. *I had a client who added direct mail to the same audience he was advertising to and his response went up 35 percent.* Every magazine will let you send direct mail to their subscribers. So if you're in a trade magazine, try mirroring your advertising campaign with a matching direct mail effort to that magazine's subscription base.	

## Marketing weapon 3: Corporate Literature
Again, the key to using these marketing weapons to their maximum po- tential is to coordinate them so that the look, feel, and content of each weapon is consistent with the others. Like your direct mail pieces, your brochure should draw from your education-based marketing efforts and should be a miniature version of your stadium pitch or core story. That means it will have riveting data that sets the buying criteria on your be- half. It will use the same exact graphics that you use in your presenta- tions, advertisements, and direct mail pieces to enhance the cohesion of your marketing efforts.

I'm working with a company called United Multi Family (www.umf. com), which sells apartment buildings. Their core story is a masterpiece. This core story has an 80 percent closing ratio. The company brochure is a miniature version of the core story, highlighting the main data in the core story. 

Let's flesh this out a little further. Most brochures are a waste of money. They are totally focused on you instead of the buyer. I call them ego pieces. Let's imagine that you are an apartment building owner. You're at a trade show for apartment building owners and on one of the tables there are dozens of brochures. Most say something like "Kimberly and Wayne: Why we're great." The only people who will pick these up will be people who already know about these companies and are interested in contacting them. But there's one that says, *"The five most dangerous trends facing apartment building owners and how to maximize your apartment building asset." Who wants to know about that?* Every apartment building owner at this trade show would want to pick up that brochure. Which brochure are you going to want to read?


## Marketing Weapon 4: Public Relations
Write down several ideas for articles that could be published in magazines, trade publications, or ezines on the Web. These same articles can become free reports that you use to market to prospects. This is how you beat the competition with your brain, not your wallet.A great core story will make this easier. Right now I'm working with two women farmers who've created a way to put images on fruit. Yes, that's right, the apple you give your kids could have Sponge Bob on it. *Their core story is about the health of Americans and how eating more fruit increases your life expectancy.* Here is one of their press releases. Note that it is full of interesting information-one of the keys for getting your press release picked up.


## Make the News
Make a list of dream media outlets that you'd like to write about your com- pany or publish your articles. If your market is local, hit your local newspa- pers constantly with ideas or items of interest. A great core story that is packed full of data will give you a lot of fodder for press releases that will attract the attention of editors or news sources.

Every press release you send should be followed by a phone call. That's how you build relationships. Here's what you say: "Did you re- ceive our press release about the amazing amount of pollutants in the home? We were wondering if there was anything we could do to help with that story." 

## Marketing weapon 5: Personal Contact
Since personal contact is such a powerful marketing weapon, we've devoted several chapters to it specifically and included more tips to help you improve this area in your business throughout the entire book. 

## Marketing weapon 6: Trade shows
When Chet came up with this idea for us he said: "Trust me. Just do it. " We did it. This particular show is one we had done every yearfor seven years. With thiS approach we got nwre leads than we had got- ten in all the previous seven years combined! We did not look like idi- ots as I thought we would. We were the life ofthe party. We decided to completely go for it, and it was a big hit.

Of course, you can go to a trade show in your normal clothes and calmly talk about your product or service to whoever happens to come. by your booth. But if you really want to tum your trade show booth into a lead-generating machine, you need to completely go for it. Tim fol- lowed the rules for a successful trade show as laid out in the paragraphs above. Take the extra steps to get noticed, drive traffic, and capture data about your prospect. Hire extra people like a massage therapist or a palm reader or models to join your staff and make your booth a magnet for everyone at the trade show. Tim's company got more leads than it had in seven previous years combined. It takes careful planning and some creativity, but it's worth every extra effort.


### Other Educational IdeasYou can also create a mass teleconference for your clients. I do these for nearly every company that hires me. One of my clients has one of the largest duck farms in the country. He sells primarily to Chinese restau- rants, but wanted to expand into all restaurants. We put on a mass tele- conference for him where restaurant owners could learn many tricks for building their traffic. And at the end of the conference, we talked about the growing popularity of duck as an entree.


### Marketing weapon 7: Internet

There are entire books on this subject, but here's my five-pronged approach to tie this together with everything else you are doing here:1. Capture leads.2. Build a relationship.3. Interact as much as possible.4. Offer a webinar (Web seminar). 
5. Convert traffic to sales.

One of the best lessons I've learned about building a healthy data- base is the concept of the "shy yes" page taught by Alex Mandossian. My main home page, www.chetholmes.com. is packed with opportunities to get things for free. At the time of this writing, that site is getting 52,000 unique visits every month. These are generally people who have heard me speak, read one of my articles, or heard about me from someone else or from some marketing we've done. On every page and at the end of evelY article, that site offers you a subscription opportunity for a free newsletter, free mass teleconference, free event, and so on. And with all that going on, only 1 percent to 3 percent of the visitors subscribe. That's 520 to 1,.560 of the 52,000.

So, using the concept of the "shy yes," we designed another site. Alex likens a Web site to trying to get a date. Ifyou ask someone to marry you the first time you talk to her, you're not likely to get a yes. But if you ask her to have a cup ofcoffee, you might get a yes. It is hard to say no to a cup ofcoffee when you're in the market for romance and you kind oflike the person. So it's an easier step.

### The Website 
Web sites suffer the same problem as most brochures. They are mostly ego pieces touting your greatness. In contrast, a Web site that offers information of value to your prospects can be a community, a place where your prospects go to look at new things, to get information, to interact with you, and to get to know you better. Have free articles, free educa- tion, free sound bites, and free insights

Once prospects have registered with your shy yes page, connect them to the rest of your world with a follow-up email or with a click-through at some point after the shy yes page. Remember, the goal is to create a marketing program in which all the pieces work together like a finely tuned machine. So your Web site should look very much like your brochure and direct mail pieces, using the same graphics, headlines, and market data from your core story.

As you learned in Chapter Four, I don't care what kind of product or service you offer, there is information that can be of value to your prospects that can soup up your ability to spread your fame and advance your brand. The information on your Web site will get search engines to send you even more leads. Then once folks come to your Web site because it has information of value to them, you can then go a step further and offer Web seminars and mass teleconferences to teach folks how to be more successful in the area in which they live that intersects with your product or service. This will get you even deeper with your prospects. So think of your Web site as a community where there are benefits to your prospects when they visit.

The education-based marketing concept that you learned in Chapter Four works hand in glove with the ability to do things over the Internet. Here's the pitch I'd do today: "How would you like to learn to make your advertising literally 10 times more effective? And you can do it right from the comfort of your favorite office chair." It's hard to resist such an offer.

Ifyou sell water (as a mundane example), you could have a site with "Everything you wanted to know about water" or "Everything you'd better know about water." This site could then show all the things that water does for the body. It could explain why you need to drink water, how much water you should drink, what the status of water is on the planet, what the different additives are in the water we drink today, and what's happening to our tap water today. Now when you're advertising your water, you can send folks to your site to learn "The five most dangerous things everyone should know about water today." Put that little plug on every bottle of water that you sell, in every ad that you have, and so on. Then have a place right on the screen that says: 'Want to make your friends healthier? Send them to this site and get a chance to win a new car." Give away one car per year, and millions will send others to your Web site where you brand like crazy-and, of course, capture emails. Now you have a free way to further your brand.


### There are mistakes that some folks will make, for sure. After I teach this material, I'll sometimes stumble on someone who has heard the concepts and liked them a lot but, in the execution, lost the real message. I will see students of this concept come out with "five reasons why our product is better than anyone else's." Who is that focused on? Who cares about your five reasons? What I care about is what five things I need to learn that will serve me. And then, once I'm into that education, make it a good one. And then somewhere along the line, you can use your product or service as an example, and that is where you get to promote your product-but always from the perspective of "what's in it for the client."

# Chapter 8: Visual Ads
We human beings remember 20 percent of what we hear, 30 percent of what we see, *but 50 percent of what we both see and hear.*

While red is the color that draws the eye the most, it may not be the color you want to use for everything. Red denotes passion, but it is also the color for danger, blood, or being "in the red" on your balance sheet. Blue says tried and true, but it also means cool and refreshing. You'll note that almost all bottled water companies use blue, as it is the color of our oceans. Orange says value. *Think Howard johnson's or Home Depot-they use orange because studies show it denotes good value.* Green is the color of money, but it's also the color of fresh greens from the garden. So color has an impact. Think about what colors you want to use. And certainly, for your corporate look and feel, you want to choose the color that best suits your main message.

In my presentations, *I use a graphic on every single panel,* and every single area I cover is what I call storyboarded. When I present the infor- mation about what the eye is drawn to, I put up a graphic of a well- developed man running on the beach. Next is a graphic of a woman in a swimming pool.

👍

*Rule 1. K.I.S.S. (Keep It Simple, Stupid)*Your presentation needs to be easy to follow and understand. Don't clutter the page with text or too many graphics. You should have no more than one big heading and only three to four bullet points per panel.

*Rule 2. K.I.F.P. (Keep It Fast paced)*
Prospects will get bored if you spend too much time on one page. You should be covering two to three panels a minute. Don't just show one and stand there and talk for 10 minutes. Keep the presentation moving.*There should be a new point coming up visually every 15 seconds or so. Or, if it is a panel with three bullets, have only one bullet come up at a time. I fall three come up, your audience will read on ahead and you will lose control. Done properly, visual aids give you more control over the communication experience at every level. In Web seminars, it's critical to have constant images Hashing across the screen. You're not in the room with them, so they can start checking email and multitasking unless you're showing so much new data or so many images every few seconds that they have no time to multitask.*

*Rule 3. Use "Wow" Facts and Statistics*
You literally want your client to say, "Wow! I didn't know that." As you learned in Chapter Four ("Becoming a Brilliant Strategist"), factual in- formation at the beginning of any presentation creates a sense of credi- bility that carries over even for the "sales" part of your presentation. But facts that are particularly jarring or revealing have a power beyond just establishing credibility. They keep people interested and give them something right off the bat to remember.

/This information was used by a client who sells supplements that im- prove your body's ability to fight toxins in the environment. His entire core story was filled with remarkable data that made people say, "Wow!”/

![](The%20ultimate%20sales%20machine%20by%20Chet%20Holmes/The%20ultimate%20sales%20machine%20by%20Chet%20Holmes/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-04%20at%2011.04.02.png)

According to research that was done for this client, in 1929 the average male's sperm count was 100 million per millilitre. By 1980 it was down to 20 million. Today it's only 5 million. While 5 million still sounds like a lot of sperm (it only takes one to get a woman pregnant), this information viewed in context of our past is pretty dam scary. The loss of sperm and infertility are worldwide problems, but they are much worse in the United States than anywhere else. This is market data and it's way more motivational than product data. Especially if you are selling nutritional supplements as this company is doing (www.primezyme.com). Again, to get "wows" you need to look at information over time. If I told you that we have 5 million sperm per millilitre, that's not big news. But when you see that it was 100 million, 70-some years ago, that's really powerful.
*Rule 4. Build in opportunities for Stories*
Well-told stories increase recall by another 26 percent over making a point without a story to illustrate it. People love stories. 

When I finished, the CEO said: "Okay. You convinced me. We'll take a page of advertising and try it out." I said, "One page is not the way to test advertising." The owner said, "Atta boy," impressed that I was pushing him to make a real commitment. He took three pages for his test. They sold training programs and needed to make 28 sales to break even on the ad. He pointed out: "I don't even need to make a profit on it-I'll make that on the back end. Once a client buys from us, they keep buying. So all I need to do is break even and we'll advertise again."

The first ad ran and they only got six responses. It was an awful response rate for an expensive magazine ad. I did tremendous amounts of follow-up. I went to see him and showed him letters with impressive success stories from other companies that had advertised in the magazine. I stayed in his face, my faith in my magazine unwavering. This is the opposite of what most salespeople do when things don't work. When a deal starts to go bad, most salespeople start to back off from calling the client. They're afraid to face the music.

"If you really want to get attention, you need to buy a full-page spread and put an insert in the middle of it. This way the magazine will open to your ad (because the insert is a card stock material). On the insert you can put an order form for folks to order." He listened and took a four color, full-page spread and insert, follow- ing my advice on content and design, in the annual trade show issue.  This story illustrates many points. If I just said to you, "Make sure you stay in your prospect's face even more if things aren't going right," that sounds good, but telling this story dramatically makes the point. 

*Rule 5. Your Presentation Should Be Curiosity Driven*
Unfold the information in a way that keeps your prospects curious. Give them a fact first and follow it with an explanation. Also, continually presell the rest of the presentation throughout the presentation. Keep alluding to information yet to come. Keep them anticipating the information you are about to tell them. For example, while presenting the information about the increase in lawyers, you could say, "And this means you have some serious competition, but the news gets worse when I show you the next point." There is a righteous presell that really makes the person want to see the next slide.

*Rule 6. Think of Each Headline as Valuable Real Estate*
Every header should work as hard as possible. It should intrigue the prospects and sell the panels. Don't waste them by being repetitious or not thinking them through. A good rule is to summarize the most important point on the panel. I've seen a lot of people build a presentation that will use the same headline (say, "Facts about the market") on several panels in a row. That might be fine for the first panel that starts off with facts about the market, but then on the next panel (which talks about growth rate of the industry or trend), put "Staggering growth rate" or "Slowing growth rate hurting us all." Don't be lazy. Work to make every headline work hard for you.

*Rule 7. Be Confident but Not Obnoxious*Another way to bond is to have them talk about their problems or the things that are not working for them in their business. Misery loves company, so engaging them on problems creates an instant bond.

*Rule 8. Focus on Them, Not on You*
Most people live their lives surrounded by mirrors, focusing on them- selves. They see their feelings, their needs. They think about how they are coming off to other people and whether or not they will get what they want. I love the line where a famous actor says to someone: "But enough of me talking about myself. What do you think about me?" Everyone's favorite topic of conversation is themselves. So turn those mirrors into windows and you will be a much better presenter, salesperson, trainer, executive, or leader. The most mature person in a relationship is the one listening the most.

## The Three Modes of Communication
The most powerful thing you can do over the telephone is to speak with what I call a voice of authority. Sound important or like the issues you are about to discuss are important. When I have a top studio head or the CEO ofa $100 billion company on the telephone, my voice communicates that I am important and that what I have to say is important as well. Practice sounding like an investigating detective with a lot of authOrity in your voice. It's a very powerful tonality and grabs the attention of your prospects right away.

For example, you can use your own body movements as well as theirs to take control of the meeting. As I just mentioned, in a large group, it's a great idea to ask people to stretch. Not only are you bonding with the audience, but you are also taking control of the meeting by telling your audience what to do. When you walk on stage and immediately tell your audience to stand up, they feel they are probably going to have a good experience because you seem so in control.

That gave me far greater control, not to mention a much better opportunity to build rap- port. So if you're presenting one-an-one, simply say: "You know what? I think I can show you this better if we sit side by side."

## Eight Common Mistakes Presenters Make
*Mistake 1: Thanking Prospects for Their Time or Apologizing**for Taking It:*I know other trainers say to thank prospects for their time, but I do not agree with that philosophy. This shows that you consider their time more valuable than yours. It also suggests to them that listening to you is far less important than other things they could be dOing. It belittles every- thing you have to say. Never apologize or thank them for their time. If you do a good job, then they will thank you.

*Mistake 2: presenting With Your Hands in Your Pockets*
This makes you look like a slacker. Always keep your hands above your waist and out in front of your body.
*Mistake 3: Presenting from a Sitting Position:* 
People will pay more for the same product when it is presented to them from a standing position.

*Mistake 4: Being Led Around by Your Nose:* 
If the prospect asks a question in the middle of your presentation, a common mistake is to interrupt what you are saying and answer it right then and there. I've seen this 100 times. If the prospect takes control of the meeting, you will not make the sale. Don't let him lead. In any sales situation, you need to take the lead. Even if you are selling retail, you're never going to close someone if you're following him around the store. Instead, ask him what he's looking for and lead him to that item in your store. Get him to follow you and you're on your way to a close. You must lead to close even if leading means asking a lot of questions. You're still the one controlling the meeting.

*Mistake 5: Letting the Materials upstage You or Guide You*
Many salespeople cling to the presentation as if that would make the sale. The presentation is never going to make the sale. You are. Visual aids are just that, aids. You are the presenter.

*Mistake 6: Keeping It Totally Serious*
Humor increases interest and retention. Every core story or presentation should have some humor built into the panels. A joke from a popular cartoon like The Far Side is great for this-you can buy the 365-day calendar and just page through it, looking for a joke that will be funny at a certain point in your delivery.

*Mistake 7: Failing to Practice the Presentation Each and Every Time Before You Give It.*
The more you know the material, the more persuasive, powerful,and effective you can be. If you are glued to the presentation and have to read it, you're in trouble. The biggest mistake most presenters make is reading the presentation without practicing aloud, pretending they have a live audience. 

• Make it exciting.• Move fast as the wind.• Make it a dynamic and compelling experience.• Know the material cold.• Draw some conclusions for your audience.• Don't read the bullets mindlessly.• Develop the "patter between the panels" covered on the next page.
*Mistake 8: Having No Idea What Comes Next in the Presentation*
You need to presell every panel if you can. Make your audience's mouths water with anticipation. "The next panel is the number one most important point I am going to show you." By knowing your material so you know what comes next, you can preframe, presell, and promise great material in the sections yet to come. This way you keep the excitement and anticipation going all through the presentation. By knowing the material cold, you can have what I call "the patter between the panels." *Draw some conclusions for your prospect/audience. Have great segues. All through the earlier chapters in this book, I reference material yet to come. That's called a presell, and you may have noticed how it made you want to continue.*

Outline a quick 30-panel presentation that you could deliver to a prospect. Write a great title that makes people want to see the presentation. On panel 2, put "Areas covered." The purpose of this panel is only to sell the heck out of the material yet to come. It's not to upstage you by giving things away. So here's a boring example of areas covered:*AREAS COVERED*• State of the industry• Five trends in our industry• How our product helps you• What you need to know about our product

There is no sizzle here. You're also telling them that there's going to be a sales pitch at the end. So let's try this:*AREAS COVERED*• State of the industry, how times have changed• Five trends that could put you out of business or send you to the stars 
• Some solutions everyone should know to succeed• How you can be ahead of the pack in every way

Finally, you should never just blatantly pitch your product. You should only use your product or service as an example. You can even have a section that says, "What to look for if you need to buy artwork." And there you can layout the "buying criteria" that will help them make a wise decision in their purchasing. If you do a great job and they agree with the criteria, you are now well on your way to their wanting your product over any other. This is a science of intelligent thinking that can reward you with much higher closing rates and a vastly improved method of getting in to see prospects.


### You will get in to see far more prospects if you offer education than you will ifyou just try to sell your product. Often, a great education can make people realize they need your product. When you offer just to sell them the product, they might not feel they need it, so you're not going to get in the door. *One last thing: Even though we have talked about all the things your "presentation" should do, never call it that to a prospect. A "presentation" sounds like a sales pitch. We call ours an "orientation." An even better term for some people is "an executive briefing.”*

## Chapter 9: Getting the Best Buyers
As you learned in Chapter Six, the Dream 100 effort is your plan of at- tack to penetrate your best buyers. This is the fastest way to becoming the Ultimate Sales Machine because these dream clients are the people or businesses that will buy your product or service faster, in greater quantities, and more frequently than any other buyers. 

*Presell:* But the chapter that follows this one also contributes Significantly as it spells out specific sales skills you're going to need to turn your dream prospects into clients.

*Executives and salespeople reading this book know they are not go- ing to give up after the first rejection; in fact, they will become more determined.*

### The Perfect-World Dream 100 Sell
1. The first thing we did was to offer the CEOs of the largest manufacturers in their market an opportunity to learn "the five most dangerous trends facing manufacturers."
2. Two weeks later we sent another letter offering the free education, but this time we included a Rubik's Cube with the following headline: "This Rubik's Cube has more than four billion possible combinations. Fortunately, there are only five that you need to worry about when it comes to being a successful manufacturer in the new millennium. Don't be puzzled by the dangers facing manufacturers! Get our free education today."
3. We followed this clever mailing with phone calls from all the salespeople. 
4. Back to the mailers: W e continued sending their dream clients a clever mailer with a cute gift every other week for five months. We sent a flash- light with the message, "Don't be in the dark about the five biggest dan- gers facing manufacturers." Then we sent a compass with a note that said: "Most companies are losing direction when it comes to manufacturing in today's environment. Don't be one of them. Get our report on the five biggest dangers facing manufacturers today." Then came a tape measure: "If you want to measure up to the highest manufacturing standards, get our free report on the five most dangerous trends facing manufacturers."
5. We had sent only four such mailers when a huge client told one of the salespeople: "Oh, yes, glad you called. I just have to have you come here and meet with me." The sales rep was so shocked he asked, "Why's that?" The client responded, "Because I've been getting all those little gifts of yours and I just think your marketing is super." 

### Six Simple steps for Getting Down to the Nitty-GrittyHere are six simple steps to help you get your dream clients:1. Choose your Dream 100.2. Choose the gifts.3. Create your Dream 100 letters.4. Create your Dream 100 calendar.5. Conduct Dream 100 follow-up phone calls. 6. Present the executive briefing.


*Step 1: Choose Your Dream 100*
In Chapter Six you made lists of your dream clients, neighborhoods, and affiliates. Take a look at those again. This is your starting point to create your Dream 100 target list. Make sure you are clear on your criteria for your dream list. What kind of clients or neighborhood qualifies as your Dream lOOP Are they successful, so they have the money to spend if they want or need to buy? If you're in healthcare, do you want to go after the biggest hospitals? If you're in real estate, you probably want to target the neighborhoods with the most expensive homes. So who is the person who can say yes to your product or service? Is your market data targeted effectively at that person?*Step 2: Choose the Gifts*
I've found that one of the best ways to get noticed by your Dream 100 is to send them small gifts every two weeks. Choose gifts like the Rubik's Cube I've already mentioned. It's just an inexpensive plastic puzzle that is slightly bigger than a cube of sugar. You want to consider many ideas for this. Just keep the gifts inexpensive. *Another key to this is that the gifts should be useful, things that they will want to keep or play with-or take home to a child. Later in the chapter we'll provide a list of ideas along with sample headlines you could utilize to accompany the mailers.*• Magnifying glass, 100 for $60• Calculator, 120 for $200• Miniature tool kit, 120 for $120 • Paddleball, 120 for $50• Glider, 1,000 for $70• Rubik's Cube, 120 for $40• Metal whistle, 120 for $100• Plastic dinosaur, 100 for $26

### Step 3: Create Your Dream 100 Letter
A letter should accompany every gift you send. The letter should be short so the prospects will read it. It should tie into the gift in some clever way. You need to offer something to which they can easily say yes. The letter must include a call to action so they know exactly what you want them to do next. Consider the letter to be like long-range bombing: it softens the prospect before you attack directly-before your salesperson calls.
So here is the strategy for penetrating an entire group of potential buyers using the concepts in this chapter. Of course, do not limit your thinking to just boats. This strategy might apply to any upscale product or service. The first step is to write a letter to the upscale homes in your area offering them something of value to them related to your product or service. Use the following boating letter as a model for your own letter: 

Dear [personalized},We are writing to you because many people in your position in lifeare now discovering the beauty, peace, and fun of having a family boat. There is no escape quite so wonderful as having a boat. It's an adventure, an opportunity to bond with family and friends, and a way to get away from everything. For a limited time, and only to people in your position, we are offering a boat day. Come and see if you love boating. We'll take yourfamily out for a fabulous day of boating. 

*Go to a Mercedes dealer and do a trade. Anyone who buys a certain price Mercedes gets a gift certificate for a sunset cruise on one of your boats. How else can you work with affiliates?*

### Step 4: create Your Dream 100 Calendar
What are you going to do to market to your Dream 100 each and every month without fail? Actually, it should be at least every month. It's even better if you send them something every two weeks. Stay in their face.

Here are some marketing tools that can be coordinated into your Dream 100 effort. 
• Cards• Letters• Novelties• Newsletters• Promos• Surveys• PR articles and press releases

### Step 5: Conduct Dream 100 Phone Call Follow-up
After every gift or mailing, you'll need to follow up with each Dream 100 prospect. This is easier with business-to-business sales as phone numbers are readily available. In business-to-consumer cases, numbers may not be listed or the prospects may be on the "do not call" list. So in the case of business-to-consumer your best bet is to continue to send the offers so consistently that everyone on that list gets to know who you are.*For business-to-business, the goal of this follow-up call is to schedule an appointment to get your core story in front of the prospect.*

Note that the salesperson said that a "speaker" would come in and present to you. Again, being a strategist means that you maximize every- thing including the words you use. The right title for your salespeople can be very strategic. As stated, no one likes to be sold to, so develop non-sales-sounding titles that position the rep better in the prospect's mind. 

*How to Get Around the Gatekeeper and Get Anyone on the Phone*
The biggest tip is that your voice has to sound like you're important.

### Let me stress one key thing: never lie. Never give false information. That doesn't mean you tell the whole truth. You just don't lie. Ever.

YOU: Hi. This is Bill Johnston. I'm calling for Carl. Is he in?
[Notice that the assistant can't ask my name, I've given it. Importantpeople give their names. And I didn't ask, "How are you today?"]

*Remember to keep a tone of authority. That keeps assistants off-guard.*

### Step 6: Present the Executive Briefing
his step has been thoroughly covered in Chapter Four on strategy and Chapter Eight on effective presentations, but here's a review of the key points to remember about building your core story: 
• Use market data, not product data.• Set the buying criteria in your favor.• Find the "smoking gun," the one thing that undeniably positionsyou over everyone else.• Make sure you hit their pain points.• Include your own pitch for your product or service only after youhave covered the education thoroughly.

The Web now makes it so that you can use both options: the rep can present over the Web or the rep can make the sale for the prospect to attend the Web seminar, and the company's best presenter can be the one to do the actual orientation or executive briefing. Check out www. gotomeeting.com, or www.livemeeting.com, or www.vlinklive.com- providers that enable you to present images over the Web while you are also on the phone with the prospect. This is a very cool way to sell. No one has to travel and sometimes it's easier to get an appointment with prospects if they don't have to commit to having you in their office. On the other hand, it's also a lot easier for them to not show up.

So if you take the Web seminar route, you must build excellent follow-up pieces that keep the prospect hot on the idea. Ifmy salespeople talk to the prospect on a Monday and set up an appointment for two days later, the prospect will get three communication pieces from us. One comes immediately to confirm the appointment and sell the heck out of the content that they're going to see. The next day the prospect will get a brief one-page letter from another executive who has seen the material and is raving about how valuable it was. Then the day of the appointment, the prospect will get a second letter raving about how good the content is. Recently, we developed a worksheet that requires prospects to fill in the blanks. The prospects look at the blanks and their brains says: "Wow, I want to know the answer to that question." For example, our worksheet has things like "[blank] is the single most important trait shared by entrepreneurs who grow their company to $100 million per year and beyond." The worksheet has two pages of teasers like that. When we started offering this worksheet, our show-up rate to the Web seminar increased by 20 percent.

*Conclusion*
An education-based Dream 100 strategy has worked again and again to help many companies penetrate impenetrable accounts or to attract those best buyers in the best neighborhoods. The biggest weakness I notice when I see companies utilize this strategy is that either they are too inconsistent or they give up too quickly. 


# Chapter 10: Sales Skills
Most companies leave far too much of the sales process up to individual salespeople. Yet, to create the Ultimate Sales Machine you must work as a team, utilizing everyone's brainpower to drill down, perfect, and procedurize each aspect of the sales process. *If you don't understand sales and you haven't defined it, you can't improve it.*

If you've ever been part of a highly trained team, you know the sense of confidence that comes with that. The secret to building an excellent sales force (or team of any kind) is in repeating core training on basic sales skills again and again.

### Sales Step 1: Establish Rapport
The magazine struggled for six months, unable to land many advertisers. And when I'd see an advertiser in there, I'd get on a plane and go take that client out for lunch. Somewhere along the line, we'd get around to talking about the competitor and I'd make my little speech. Here's the key: All my clients were also my friends. To advertise in a directly competitive magazine was almost a violation of our relationship. But not every salesperson is built this way, so set up procedures or opportunities to build relationships and have fun with the client.

A restaurant, a bookstore, a supermarket, a copy center: I don't care what kind of business you're in, you need to make "client rapport" part of the process and every person working for you needs training on this.

1. Let's break it down. One thing you can do to establish trust is to make your prospects feel that they are working with an expert. As you learned in Chapter Four, selling breaks rapport (no one wants to feel like you're selling them), while educating builds it. That is why I have every single company that I work with design a core story packed with data of great value to your prospects.
	1. Ask great questions. Establish rapport-building questions that your sales team will ask every prospect. Teach your salespeople to use those questions to make a connection, to find common interests. Also, "get personal." As fast as you can, get into the person's world. You can start with questions that seem like business questions, but they are personal questions: How long have you been doing this? Oh, really, how do you like it? What got you into it? What did you do before this? These kinds of questions help you create a deeper bond. Remember, everyone's favorite person to talk about is themselves. Can you go deeper? Ask these: What do you do for fun? What do you do to be creative? What are your hobbies? Naturally, you have to build up to some of these.
	2. Have a sense of humor. Have fun together. My stockbroker calls me with the "joke of the week" and they're actually funny. Now the Internet makes it easy to forward a good joke, but don't be one of those people who sends every little joke. My clients know that if I send them something, it's going to be really funny. Therefore my emails get opened and answered.
	3. Find the common ground. I had a terrible time bonding with one client until we discovered that we both liked the same band. In fact, we grew up listening to the same album. It was like a magic key to unlocking a bond that we share to this day. Find the common ground. Hunt for the things that you can relate to.

### Sales Step 2: Qualify the Buyer (Find the Need)
QualifYing buyers means finding out what they are looking for in your product or service and what factors will influence them to buy. In this step you need to learn everything you can about their existing buying criteria, but the key to developing your Ultimate Sales Machine is to re- set that bUying criteria so that your product or service becomes the most logical choice.

1. How do your customers find out about you right now?2. What's the most effective way you have for gaining new clients? 3. What's the amount of your average sale? (This enabled us tocost-justify. Meaning, if their product cost $400 and the ad cost $4,000, then they only needed 10 sales to justify the cost of the advertising. )4. What are the three biggest problems you're having in [your area of business]? (Get their pain and help solve it.)5. How long have you worked here?6. How'd you get started?7. What are your goals for your company?8. What are your goals for yourself?9. What are your criteria for making a decision about buying aproduct or service like ours?

Additionally, when you understand their personal and business goals and their needs, you will be able to show them how your product or service can help them achieve their goals and fulfill those needs. 

On their own, most companies just don't go this deep. Yet if you study their best producers, you'll find variations on all these rapport- developing techniques. Your job is to set up systems, procedures, and training that create a machine where every salesperson gets deep with your prospects. In the words of Jay Abraham, "If you truly believe that what you have is useful and valuable to your clients, then you have a moral obligation to try to serve them in every way possible." 

## Sales step 3: Build value
After you have assessed your customers' buying criteria, you must begin to build value around your product or service. You've already built rapport. You've asked a lot of questions. Now you ask them, "How much do you know about us, by the way?" An even more powerful way to do this, as you have learned, is to pre- sent your core story/executive briefing. This orientation should be targeted to the buyer, not to your product or service.

They have the best education you will ever see in a shoe store. I've described the data they had on feet, fashion, and footwear, but did you know there's a thing called "the threshold effect"? This study shows that when you walk into a room, people make 11 different assumptions about you (such as your level of education and economic bracket), strictly based on your appearance. Your clothes and, yes, your shoes add to or detract from the impression you make. If a shoe store salesperson can show you all this information, do you think it builds value in that store and that salesperson?
How you introduce the education to your clients is as important as the education itself. *You need to presell everything* you are about to tell them. For a clothing store you might say:

/Our company has commissioned research on dressing for success. Surveys show that 90 percent of people who wear suits don't know the perfect combinations of styles and the impressions your clothes make on others. *Let me take you through some of this data.*/

In business-to-business situations, often your core story is the reason you are in front of them in the first place, as you saw in the examples of the newspaper company and the company that sold art to hospitals. It's easy to introduce market education as long as it selVes the prospect: *"Whether you ever do business with us or not, you should know some of this data we've gathered on being successful in your marketplace."*

## Sales Step 4: Create Desire
Now it is time to make your client want your product or service and want it right now. There are a lot of things you can do to increase this desire. As I've mentioned, two powerful techniques are:1. Lead them through a series of questions in which you intensify their need from their perspective.2. Present killer data that truly motivates your buyer to take action now.

Be clear on this important point: Your buyers will be a lot more motivated if their current situation becomes unacceptable. To create desire, you must motivate your buyers using a combination of problems and solutions, even if you are the one pointing out the problems that they haven't really considered. Market data and your core story can do this well.Once you have shown them the problems, paint the picture of their wonderful future with your products or service and you will create desire. Just be sure you are painting a picture of their future and not just your products. Remember that features tell, benefits sell. Don't tell them what it is, but rather why they need it.

### Sales Step 5: Overcome Objections
As I already mentioned, the best close of all is when the buyers make their own decision to buy because it's the most logical conclusion they can draw from the information you've given them. Again, the core story should work really well to reset the buying criteria and bring the sale to a logical close as explained in Chapter Four. You can also ask questions that show them the cost or downfall of not moving forward with your product or service. My salespeople ask questions such as:• What is your biggest marketing challenge?• What would it be worth to you if this challenge could be fixedforever?• What does it cost you to not fix this problem?
When prospects thinks of it like that and learn that working with us can fix that challenge forever, they close the sale themselves.

### Sales Step 6: Close the Sale
Although the goal is to set up such logical buying criteria that the prospect and the salesperson walk to the close together, it should also be stated that most people need help in making decisions.

Important lesson. This comes from "weak ego strength," as explained in Chapter Five. Inside, this salesperson was afraid to make the sale, do the close, or apply any pressure whatsoever, because the fear of rejection was making her weak. That's why most salespeople don't close well: weak ego strength and fear of rejection.

Your job, Chet, is to help people make that decision to buy. That is the greatest weakness in folks-they're not good at making decisions. If you truly believe that your prospect should benefit from your product or service, it's your moral obligation to help them make a decision and get on with their lives.

Other ways to induce people to buy faster and with greater enthusi- asm include risk reversal and offering a free product or service with the sale. Can you add on something that motivates them to buy right now? Or can you reverse the risk (a concept that Jay Abraham teaches) so all of their objections are neutralized?My company sells a comprehensive training program and then we add on a few thousand dollars' worth ofbonuses. Here's our risk reversal (paraphrased): "We're so sure that this program is going to help you, we're going to give you $2,000 in bonus products. Take this program and use it. If you feel it is not more than 1,000 times worth the investment, send it back and get a complete refund. And for your trouble, you can keep the $2,000 in bonus products."## Sales Step 7: Follow up

*Conclusion*
These seven steps are core sales skills and procedures. Just as basketball coaches must constantly train their players on lay-up shots and blocking, sales managers must constantly train their reps on polishing every angle of the seven steps to every sale. *Smart companies build tools, policies, and procedures that support these seven steps. The more standards you set, the higher the performance you can expect from every level of talent.*

 
# Chapter 11: Follow Up
*How to Keep Clients Forever and Dramatically Increase Your Profits*

Yet it costs six times more to get a new client than to sell something additional to a current client. If you want to build the Ultimate Sales Machine, you need to have highly procedurized follow-up and follow-through.

You need to have excellent follow-up procedures to stay at the top of your client's mind.

### The Cool-Off Factor
They need to stay hot on you, not just on what you're selling. If you made a good impression, you have to "keep those cards and letters com- ing." 

*The real success formula for selling:**Trust and respect = Influence = Potential for control = More market share at every mutually beneficial opportunity*

Make the relationship fun and entertaining by incorporating into your follow-up such things as cards, letters, games, jokes, and gifts. For business-to-consumer companies, you need to have a constant touch system to keep the relationship strong. This may mean a VIP card that your clients can use to get express service or special benefits. It may be personalized invitations to come to a special VIP sale preview event or to remind your clients of their next scheduled appointment. With the In- ternet, this can be inexpensive or even free. Again, it should be stressed that "education-based marketing" is an excellent method of staying in touch. No matter what you sell, you can find valuable information that your client will appreciate receiving.

Let's look at a practical example: At the time of this writing, I went to the official Web sites of Disney, Warner Bros., and Universal Studios. Looking around, I could not easily find anywhere to subscribe to be on an email list to receive promotions. IfI owned a studio, the most prominent graphic on the Web site would be an offer that would capture data to be- gin a relationship with every fan coming to the site. One of my goals would be to collect millions of fan emails.This would hedge my investment, giving me an opportunity to promote my movies in advance and build an even stronger brand with moviegoers. The home page should give ethical bribes to fans to get their email: "Enter your email address and win a chance to have dinner with a star." 

*No matter what you sell, you can create a better relationship with your buyers using the Internet. But the main point is to have constant follow-up efforts with buyers-especially with those who did not buy.*

## Set Yourself up for Great Follow-up
• *Create rapport.* What professional goals did you note dUring the meeting? How can you help prospects achieve those goals? What personal tidbit, common interest, or funny story can you refer to later to remind them of your bond?
• *Qualify and establish need.* Do you understand prospects' needs and objectives? What are their most pressing problems and how can you help solve them?
• *Build value.* What do they consider valuable? What benefits or add- ons would appeal to them and build the value around your product or service?• *Create desire.* What are their hot buttons that can increase their desire? What is the pain point that you can use to remind them of why they bought and why they will want to keep buying from you? Remember that people naturally gravitate away from problems and toward solutions.• *Overcome objections.* What are their objections and how can you put them to rest?• *Close.* What closed them?

### By the time they were in the follow-up phase, my sales staff had plenty of information.

## 10 Steps to Great Follow-up
### Follow-up Step 1: Send the First Follow-up Letter
If you sell business-to-business, get a letter off to your client within an hour or two of your meeting. 
1. Start with something personal that you remember from the meeting. Example: "That was a great story you told about your daughter. In our next meeting, I have a similar story to tell you."
2. Include a compliment.Example: "You certainly seem to have a great grasp on how tomake your company succeed. They are lucky to have you."
3. Push their hot buttons and stay focused on the benefits your product or service offers to them.Example: "With the challenge you face, it seems clear that six of our machines are exactly what you need. You will reduce costs, speed up productivity, and, most important, relieve a lot of stress for quite a few people. I'm checking on how fast we can move on this one."

4. Use a personal close.Example: "Once again, it was great meeting you. I have a few ideasabout some other productivity issues that I know you will like."

# As stated, never apologize for taking their time. You must feel that your time is also valuable and they are lucky to be meeting with you because you are bringing them important insights and solutions. 
I responded proudly, "That was the senior vice president of Xerox." He continued, "What in the world do you have to say that would keep you on the phone for an hour!" And here I was amazed that I got deep enough rapport that this execu- tive wanted to stay on the phone with me for an hour.

Now imagine if this suit store had a club membership or, even better, a "wardrobe analysis" or "dress for success" program. Then every email that followed could provide information of value to me, keeping me up- dated with the latest fashion insights. This is applicable for practically any type of retail situation, outside of mass marketers.

## Follow-up Step 2: Make the First Follow-up Call
The follow-up call should come right after the letter. It should offer something of value, something that doesn't necessarily have to benefit your company directly. You're trying to bond with your client, so this follow-up call does not have to be selling them anything. 

If you're business-to-business and you had a good meeting, you should now be working your way into your client's staff as someone bringing enough value that they let you into their world. This is how I became top producer at every company. I became such a valued con- tributor it was like I was on my clients' staffs. 

## Follow-up Step 3: Share Something Amusing or of Personal Interest
As you learned in Chapter Ten, you are establishing rapport through- out the sales process so you can use similar approaches. As mentioned in that section, send an amusing cartoon or article that you know will be of interest to them. Even if it does nothing else but make them smile and laugh, it's building that bond and keeping that top-of-mind status. So send something of interest to them every month. Don't sell; just schmooze.

## Follow-up Step 4: Throw a party, Share a Meal, and Bond Like Crazy
Sharing a meal with your clients is another great way to bond. Here's the scale of bonding effectiveness:
Breakfast: Good rapport 
Lunch: Good rapport 
Dinner: Great rapport
Here's a script you can use: "I did some research about your industry and learned some interesting things. If we can get together for a breakfast or lunch, I'll take you through some of this information. "

## Follow-up Step 5: Send Another Fax/Email/Letter/Card
Ifyou get top-of-mind awareness, you need to never let it go. With un- ceasing follow-up you'll never lose a client to a competitor. If you've just had a meal with your client or she's attended a party or event you've spon- sored, follow up immediately with another letter. 

Dear Gail:You make a great lunch guest. I wish all my clients had your senseof humor . I was intrigued by your thoughts on direct mail, so I've asked forsomefurther research. I'll let you know when it comes in. Meanwhile, stay away from those anchovies.
These letters are short and interesting. Be personal and complimentary, and tell them what the next step will be in your relationship. Kevin's letter to Gail tells her that he'll take the next step by doing some extra research for her and let her know when it comes in.

## Follow-up Step 6: Plan Something Fun That Can Include the Family
If you're business-to-business and your clients are big enough to war- rant it, you can invite your clients to join you in fun activities such as boating, tennis, hot air ballooning, or scuba diving. The more memorable the experience, the cooler it can be, the more likely the client will not only go, but will talk about it to others. You're becoming part of their lives. Look for something exciting that you can do together. It might be your nature to do these things, *but if it's not or if you have salespeople, you need to build them into procedures.*

## Follow-up step 7: Offer Something to Help Their Business
Can you be the king or queen of networking? Great companies are always finding ways to help their clients succeed. Can you hook up two clients to form a referral network? When we sold advertising, we would take up-and-coming companies and get them together with much larger companies. This often resulted in relationships that were of value to both players. For that reason, my clients always took my calls-always. Since they never knew what cool new thing I was going to offer, they always welcomed, and even looked forward to my calls. Be a resource.

# Follow-up Step 8: Send Another FaXiEmail/Letter/Card
Your client needs to hear from you often so that you become permanently bonded. Keep sending follow-up notes and jokes. If you become best friends with your clients, it will be natural to keep doing these things.

## Follow-up Step 9: Offer More Help to SucceedWhat else can you do to help your clients succeed? Perhaps you could take them to a seminar or give a seminar at their location. You could give them a training course on some topic they are having trouble with or that would help their business. You could help them find new personnel or alert them to important trends in their market. We are working with a restaurant chain that is offering business owners lunch and learns as a way to bond better with companies in their area. This gives them an excuse to call business owners and invite them to something cool. 

By this ninth follow-up step, you are becoming a valuable asset and trusted confidant to your clients. This breeds remarkable customer loyalty so that customers will feel like they are engaging in a personal betrayal if they buy from a competitor. *Loyalty gives you unequaled control over market share and the inside track on everything your customer is thinking.* Since it's so expensive to gain new clients today, what can you do to establish an unbreakable bond?

## Follow-up step 10: The Ultimate Follow-Up; Invite Them to Your Home or Be Invited to Theirs
When you have them in your home or they have you in theirs, you know you have done fantastic follow-up. Here are some revealing quotes from top producers on the importance of this step:
"Every important client I have has dined in my home.""Half the people at my wedding were my clients.""From their dreams to their hobbies, to their children's hobbies, Iknow everything about my top clients."

### Bonding is everything. Your ultimate goal is that all of your biggest clients also become your best friends. Become involved in their lives and n the success of their businesses. Make it your personal mission to help them succeed. The bottom line is that you need to do follow-up or you will be mediocre. With a fantastic, structured follow-up, you will propel yourself so far above your competitors that they won't be able to touch you or your clients.

# Chapter 12 All Systems GO
Goal setting and measuring effectiveness is the 12th core skill area of the Ultimate Sales Machine, and it's designed to soup up all 11 that come before it.

### As you've learned throughout this book, mastering anything is not about doing 4,000 new things, but doing 12 things 4,000 times.

## What we Think Defines Who We Are
*Our cells are completely reactive to the environment in which they dwell, and thought is one of the most powerful sources for creating that environment. Some now say that if you're angry, fearful, or anxious when you eat or drink, you literally poison the food you're putting into you're body*

So if you're telling it you can't do some- thing, guess what? You won't be able to do it. Worrying has the same impact. If you worry about a problem, your subconscious thinks the problem is what's important to you and it won't help you find solutions. To find solutions, you have to change your thinking from worrying about the problem to demanding solutions. I've done it 100 times in seemingly impossible situations.

I have even applied this information to how I raise my children. When either of them says anything like "I can't" or 'Tm no good at that," I say, "What's that called?" They moan, "Failure reinforcement." One day when my son was learning tennis, he said, "I just can't get the hang of that serve." Then he looked at me and caught himself. "But I'm getting better every day." They may have moaned and groaned, but in no time they were both seeing the fantastic results that come when you focus your RAS on what you want in your life instead of what you don't.

*Attitude is the only thing we can control in life, yet it's also the most powerful. You can't control your spouse, your kids, the weather, your co- workers, or the economy. You can try to better understand each of them, but you can't control them. All you can control is your perception and your attitude. The good news is that perception and attitude are all you need to control to achieve your goals and dreams in life and business.*

## Harnessing the Power of the RAS
When I go in to help a company that's in trouble, the most powerful thing I do is to get them focused on solutions and setting goals for improving the situation. This shift in focus shows up in the results the company is getting. With everyone devoting at least an hour a week to focusing their RAS on finding solutions and improving the business, solutions begin to appear and the business begins to improve. One way to harness the power of the RAS is to do proactive workshops to get everyone focused on solv- ing the problems instead of focusing on the problems.

## A Shortcut
Keeping your mind focused on your success may be difficult at first, but here's a shortcut to help you make the transition. Your mind is more receptive when it is less busy. Right before you go to bed and right when you wake up, you are at your most receptive. That's the best time to really focus your RAS on all the positive things you want in your life. If you picture yourself succeeding or overcoming something at those times, your brain will grab hold of that much easier. 

It's important to keep your brain working in the present. Tell your- self, "It's a great day today," rather than "I will have a great day today." Or "Success comes to me easily" rather than "Success will come to me easily." This is called autosuggestion. Phrase your goals and desires as if they already exist because then your brain will work on fulfilling them faster for you. If you say you will be a billionaire, the brain says: "Oh, okay. I will do it. That means I don't have to do it right now." Instead say, "I am a billionaire." Then your brain says: "Oh, wow, I have to make that happen."

Thomas Edison, who invented the lightbulb, the movie camera, and dozens of other ingenious things, said, "Never go to sleep without a re- quest to your subconscious." You can actually pose something to your subconscious as you go to sleep and wake up with the solution in mind. For 12 years, I listened to a tape of my own voice every single night before I went to sleep. I was talking directly to my subconscious and I played the tape when my mind was most receptive. My income doubled for three years in a row.

## Sales Affirmations
In each of my weekly sales meetings, I make every salesperson repeat after me as I give them various affirmations. One of my favorites for salespeople is "I love to cold-call in the morning." When I was a sales rep, I wrote those words on a sheet of paper and put it up on the wall in front of me. I would then say them out loud and with great fun in my voice. If you are in sales or run a sales team, there simply is no better affirmation. Cold calling is the toughest activity for most salespeople. Me, I love to cold-call in the morning. I suppose it's from years of repeat- ing that affirmation.

## Using Your RAS in Coal Setting
To get the most out of goal setting, make sure you set incremental goals as well as long-term goals. Your incremental goals should be things that are challenging but that you know you can achieve. This way you make it easier on yourself to stay focused on your success. If you make outrageous goals and never achieve them, then you reinforce your own failure.

## Measuring Effectiveness: Keys to Increasing Performance
Another way to achieve goals quickly is to measure effectiveness every step of the way. If you are constantly measuring effectiveness, then you will be able to quickly and easily adjust when something is not bringing about your desired result.
P.236*People respect what you inspect. So when I work with companies, we put all kinds of measurement systems into place.* 

For every single call he made there should have been a follow-up action.

"You just hung up on me, but I don't think you under- stood the significance of my call or you would not have done so. Consider this: [pitch again what they'll learn from the "orientation"]. The second largest expense in your company is the cost of employee benefits. I teach nine different ways to reduce those costs, something I'm sure you would find quite valuable. I will contact you again to give you another opportu- nity to gain this valuable information."

Dear Kathy,As you requested when we spoke on the phone today, I will callyou back on Friday at 3 PM. At that time we will discuss five important ways you can save money on your insurance while still offering your employees the best in healthcare coverage.

Remember that the hardest part of sales is getting their attention in the first place, so once you have it, you need to follow up so well they don't have a chance to forget you.

This single sales performance document is not just a measuring tool but a management tool. You'll note that this particular salesperson didn't do all the follow-up he should have for the effort he made at the top of the document. So when I received this call sheet, I was able to train and improve the rep's skills based upon the data reported.

## Contests
Henry Ford used a similar tactic, but he didn't even need to create a reward for the increase in productivity. As Napoleon Hill mentioned in Think and Grow Rich, Ford went onto the factory floor with a can of paint and put a large number 6 in the middle of the floor. When the night workers asked what it meant, he told them that it was the number of cars the day crew built. The next morning he came in and learned the night crew had built seven cars. He then painted a 7 over the 6 that had been there. When the day crew asked about it, he told them that that was how many cars the night crew had built. Just by playing the day crew off the night crew, he was able to substantially increase productivity for his factory.


## Final Case StudyFirst, we went totally generic and offered a presentation called "How to Succeed in the Legal Market" based on all the core story research we had done. The research was amazing. According to the U.S. Census Bu- reau, lawyers are the largest daily producers ofwords. They put out more data every day than any other business or profession. This, and their high income and profits, made them an excellent target for technology com- panies. So the first part of the sale was not to sell our magazine at all, but rather to educate companies on why they need to be interested in the le- gal market.

But now, even if I were to make the first sale-that of getting large companies to take an interest in the legal field as a fertile vertical mar- ket-my regional publication was not a viable place to advertise. Ifthey went in California alone, what kind of thinking would that be?So the next part of the sale had to give brilliant justification: it had to set the buying criteria. We had all this data on California as "the state that leads the nation." At the time, the average state had 18,000 lawyers, while California had 143,000 lawyers (today California has more than 200,000 lawyers). Huge difference. California led the nation in cutting-edge legal initiatives and thinking. In fact, more precedent-setting law comes out of California than any other state. One third of all the nation's largest corporations house their corporate counsel in California. The data went on and on, effectively showing that if you really want to make it in the legal market, first, you must have a stronger position in California than anywhere else, and next, you could test the legal market in one state before spending larger dollars to go national.*So let's break this down into steps:*
• Step 1: What is your best possible strategic position? In our case, we established our position as part of a market that was superwor- thy for them to go after.• Step 2: Next we established our position at the top of that market so they knew that of all the choices they could make to penetrate this market, advertising in our magazine was the most potent.• Step 3: We put all this into an "educational orientation" and made that our first offer to every advertiser.• Step 4: We mounted a Dream 100 effort, where we started hitting the biggest possible advertisers so hard, so frequently, and with so many approaches and offers that they got to know exactly who we were in a very short period of time.• Step 5: I rehearsed the sales staff on that presentation again and again and again. Still, there were those who didn't get the strategy: 'Wait. Why would I do all this when all I really want to do is sell ad- vertiSing?" I took these more tactical executives by the hand, brought them to client meetings, and showed them the awesome power of using market data as a motivator. They caught on pretty quickly at that point.
* Step 6: I worked through the time management procedures daily, constantly demanding to-do lists from the staff.* Step 7: I trained the staff on the "Seven Steps to Every Sale" in great detail. I gave spot quizzes, did workshops on every step, and hot-seated the reps on specific accounts and their activities related to the seven steps.* Step 8: I worked the heck out of the follow-up procedures, putting into place more and more opportunities for bonding and building valuable relationships.* Step 9: We worked the trade shows like champions, always being the life of every party and throwing the best parties. Eventually, we started our own trade show for all the advertisers in the industry to come and learn how to market better to attorneys. We designed an award ceremony that celebrated the top executives in the industry and brought them all to a black-tie affair in which we controlled every inch of the experience.* Step 10: We offered many other additional services that gave us unbreakable bonds with our clients. We had a free placement ser- vice to help marketing executives get jobs with other advertisers. We gave the entire market the industrywide calendar that every company used for its trade show planning. We deSigned ads for all our advertisers.* Step 11: W e set goals for every area of performance.* Step 12: We measured and tracked every activity and had regularcontests and rewards for our top performers.

# Here's my promise to you: if you make this book your sales, marketing, and management bible and study it again and again, you'll never need to know anything else to rule your market. That and pigheaded determination.
