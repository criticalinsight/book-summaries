# Selling to VITO
#1 read/books/sales#

# Introduction
Which is that VITO cares about the results of anything and everything sold to VITO, Inc. Guess what? I was right! After more than two decades of field testing, I’ve proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that VITO does care, VITO does decide quickly, and *VITO does buy every single item whose results can help in the overachievement of VITO’s goals.* Not only does VITO buy—VITO buys big!

# Chapter 1: Meet VITO, the Very Important Top Officer
I listened to that little voice, and thank God I did, because once I started listening, I started calling at the top of the organisation. It was at this fateful point in my career that I started Selling to VITO.

Remember that telephone pole my eagle landed on? How many tops did it have? That’s right: one. If that telephone pole represented the corporate “org chart,” the very top of it is where you would find the main character of this book: VITO!

### Vito Rule #0: (The rule from which every other VITO Rule is derived!): VITO is the ultimate approver of everything that happens in the organization, including your sale.

# Chapter 2: Are You Ready to Sell to VITO?
*Vito Insight #1: You have more in common with VITO than you think.*
* For starters, VITOs have big egos! A healthy ego is a defining trait of high achievers, and it’s certainly a defining trait among VITOs.
* What else? Power, control, and authority are important to VITOs.
* VITOs are brief, direct, and to the point.
* VITOs are self-assured, self-determined, driven to success, and goal and results oriented.
* VITOs are passionate and highly competitive; they love to win and hate to lose.
* VITOs are seekers of information that will give them an edge.
* VITOs are constantly on the lookout for ideas that will help themover-accomplish their goals, plans, and objectives.
* VITOs are well read, well informed, and highly knowledgeable about the industry in which they’re operating.
* VITOs live in a time-compressed world. They have learned, from personal experience, the importance of investing their precious time with people they feel will help them quickly prosper.
* For the most part, VITOs have an “early adopter” mentality; they spend time looking for good ideas that no one else has yet embraced.
* VITOs are risk takers and straight shooters. They like being asked direct questions and they like individuals who will give them direct answers to the questions they ask.

How many of the VITO traits, characteristics, and attitudes you just read out loud do you have? You may not have the title of a VITO, but you are very much like VITO. 

*Vito Insight #2: VITOs need what you have.*

Picture VITO driving to work early in the morning in a high-powered luxury sedan. What do you suppose VITO is thinking about during that drive?
1. VITOs in similar industries have similar goals, plans, and objectives.2. VITOs in all industries share the same basic “short list” of critical goals, plans, and objectives.

/Once you know what’s on the “short list,” you can connect with a VITO in virtually any industry; that is, if you can offer something that appeals to an item on VITO’s “short list.”/

Here is VITO’s “short list:”1. Increasing revenues and exceeding the projected revenue plan2. Increasing efficiencies and effectiveness of:»» Revenue-generating employees »» Mission-critical employees»» Mission-critical processes»» Workflow and related operations»» Procurement»» Capital resources»» Customer-facing services3. Cutting and or containing costs and moving away from unpredictable expenses and toward accurate, forecasted budgets.4. Staying in compliance; operating well within the corporate culture on critical decisions; staying on the right side of all relevant governmental regulations and the law.

With this list in mind, let’s focus for a moment on the product, services, and solutions you sell. Take your time. Use the following “mind joggers” to help you get started:

### Spend a minimum of ten minutes on each of these:1. How does what I sell impact top line revenues?2. How does what I sell impact the efficiencies of direct sales, online sales, brand awareness, marketing, operations, finance, manufacturing, customer service?3. How does what I sell help contain or cut costs?
4. How does what I sell assist in compliance operations, keeping people and organizations out of legal trouble?

# The big question: Of the four results where all VITOs want to overachieve, how many can your product, service, or solution help them with?

VITOs need what you have. VITO is waiting for you to show up with a letter, e-mail, fax, telephone call, voice mail message, Tweet, Facebook entry, or your old-fashioned smiling face in his or her lobby.

*Vito Insight #3: You are VITO*
Every sales job comes with expectations. You will realize that the expectations you are responsible for boil down to these four:

1. Revenue generation2. Effectiveness/efficiency/resource management3. Cost and time containment4. Compliance

Look familiar? It should. You and VITO are measured in pretty much the same basic ways. 

# What VITO wants to accomplish at VITO, Inc. is what you want to accomplish for yourself and the organisation you sell for.
Let’s look at where we are so far. VITO sits at the top or the organization and has the ultimate veto power. VITO’s traits and your traits are quite similar. The results VITO wants to achieve with his or her organization and the results you want to achieve.

Once you’ve processed all that, say these VITO Rules out loud:
1. VITO will like me because I am like VITO.
2. VITO will like what my product can do for him or her because it’s in alignment with what VITO wants.
3. I am measured at my job as a salesperson in a way that’s similar to how VITO is measured at the job of Very Important Top Officer.

# Chapter 3: Spotlight on the Sales Process
A sales process is a series of sequential steps taken over some quantifiable period of time. When these steps are followed, they convert *suspects* (people you have not sold to yet, but want to) into *prospects* (people who are talking to you about buying your stuff) into *customers* (you know what those are), yielding a completed sale that puts commission dollars in your purse or pocket and delivers revenue to the top line of the company you work for.

*Step One:* Create your sales process*Step Two:* Analyze your sales process*Step Three:* Improve your sales process*Step Four:* Replicate your sales process (as quickly as possible!)

A sales process is a series of sequential steps taken over some quantifiable period of *TIME.*

# Vito Rule #4: Because time is so valuable, VITOs don’t treat all potential business relationships equally, and neither should you.
Your time, your organization’s resources, and your revenue fore-casts must reflect your most intelligent use of time with various people in different business relationship categories.

## Six Important Categories
*Suspects:* Pre-qualification filter or list of criteria, whether that’s a profileAre individuals or organizations who fit some developed by your marketing department or your own quantified set of criteria, which I call the Template of Ideal Prospect (T.I.P.), about which you’ll hear more in an appendix at the end of this book.
*Prospects* are those individuals or companies that have already been contacted by some method and who comply with the criteria necessary to become customers, business partners, and/or distributors and whom you are currently in a dialog with. The key word here is “currently.”
*Customers* currently buy from you. Here again, the key word is“currently.”
*Business partners* not only buy from you currently but also prosper from their relationship with you in a way that clearly surpasses what your product, service, or solution does for them. That means, for instance, that you might share critical knowledge, strategic resources, leads, prospects, or even customers with business partners for mutually beneficial reasons.
*Distributors* are individuals or organizations that take your products, services, and/or solutions, add some kind of direct or indirect value, and maybe even take your name off and put theirs on and resell it.
*Advocates* can also fall into one or more of the above categories. This is an individual or organization eager to see you succeed in your sales efforts and willing to help you sell. Over the years, advocates have also been called “inside coaches” or “sponsors.”

### Target Pipeline Numbers

> Suspects = 0 percent (They don’t belong in your sales forecast.)   
> Prospects = 75 percent  > Customers (including Business Partners and Distributors) = 25 percent  > Advocates = 50 percent or greater (Remember, Advocates overlap the other categories; they’re your cheerleaders within the buying enterprise. When I say 50 percent of your opportunities or greater should be advocates, I mean that at least half of your Prospects and at least half of your Customers should have a strong Advocate within the organization who’s helping you.)  

### What Would VITO Do?

Whom do you think VITO would call? What title do you think VITO would set up a meeting with? If you answered another VITO, give yourself a gold star! 

# Vito Rule #5: When you fly with VITO, everybody else in the organization follows!
Be personally accountable for each and every step of your own sales process.

# Vito Rule #6: Be accountable for your own sales process
No room for excuses. No room for rationalizations. You either know the process or you don’t. You either execute the process or you don’t.

Since I don’t know what your process looks like, I’ll start by doing the next best thing, which is to give you a look at my sales process!

*Step 1:* I send the VITO I want to sell to one of my best-selling books, along with a custom-made bookmark that outlines my value proposition for that VITO’s company in one sentence. I include a special letter I call a VITO letter, which you’ll be learning a lot more about later on in this book. In that letter, I promise my target VITO a phone call at a specific date and time.

*Step 2:* I call at the appointed time to follow up.
No connection? I leave a powerful voice mail message.
No return call? I leave another, slightly different, voice mail message—one each week for several weeks—until I receive a call back.

*Step 3:* I get a return call or make telephone connection with VITO.
During that call, I find out if VITO’s goals, plans, and objectives can be helped by my value proposition.

*Step 4:* I present the agreement; we sign it.

*Step 5:* I conduct the event.

*Step 6:* I track and broadcast results to all other divisions/sistercompanies; I generate referrals, both internal and external.

*Step 7:* Based upon the results, I suggest other products, services, and solutions that (you guessed it) add even greater value to my business relationship.

*The first five steps of this seven-step sales process can take anywhere from one to four months; the average is a little over two and a half months.*

*VITOs have a responsibility to implement constant, never-ending improvement.* This commitment requires them to look in every corner of their business for ideas to make whatever is being done be done better, faster, less expensive. You must make the same commitment.


# Chapter 4: Replicate, Replicate, Replicate
## Vitor Rule #7: A process isn’t a process unless you can replicate it.

![](Selling%20to%20VITO/Selling%20to%20VITO/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-07%20at%2010.55.21.png)

Of course, VITO sits at the very top of the organization. VITO has the ultimate veto power over absolutely everything that takes place in the organization. What I want to draw your attention to now, though, is not the eagle perched at the top of the pole but the resident of Linoleumville who sits close to the bottom of the organization. This person I call *“Seemore.”*

Seemore can be male or female. Seemore has titles like Data Center Manager, Head IT Supervisor, Programmer, Research Analyst, Engineer, Buyer, Purchasing Agent, Head Accountant, and Programmer— get the picture? Seemores are scientists, analysts, troubleshooters, and technical gurus. As good as they are at what they do, and as important as they are within the organization, they tend to drive us salespeople nuts! Why? Because they always want to see more. 

What Seemore doesn’t do (at least not without great difficulty) is make independent decisions at work, about purchases or anything else.

### . . . Never . . .Seemore never makes a decision on his or her own authority

*Doing the VITO Dance means taking the first steps in your sales process—outreach, initial voice mail and follow-up, and voice-to-voice contact—with VITO, rather than with Seemore (or anyone else). It’s that simple.*

Let me be clear here: I’m not saying you must eliminate Seemore from the sales process. If you forget all about Seemores, they will find a way to get even with you! They will sabotage anything and every-thing you try to sell. You want to keep Seemores involved. You don’t want to begin your sales process with them.

# When you reach out, you will reach out to VITO first. 
I can tell you from my own experience and the experience of over 2.5 million other salespeople that three very good things will happen when you hold yourself accountable for doing, and replicating, the VITO Dance.
* *You will get bigger initial sales—up to 54 percent bigger,* as demonstrated by a major client of mine! Why would your initial sales size grow when you put VITO first? Because everything is bigger in VITO’s world: the office, the desk, the responsibilities—some people might even say VITO’s head is bigger! *When VITOs buy, they buy big.*
* *You will close deals faster—typically 50 percent faster!* This, too, is only logical. VITOs are fast thinkers who take action quickly once they have examined all the angles. They are not going to wait around for anybody to do anything just for the sake of waiting. 
* *You will win more add-on business from your existing clients*— up to 120 percent more, as my own client base has shown!


Your “decision maker” isn’t really the decision maker.## VITO RULE  #8 Above every Decision Maker, and above every decision in the enterprise, sits VITO— the approver of the sale and everything else.
Forget the rationalizations. Forget the excuses. Forget about what you’re used to doing. When you get right down to it, the only reality that matters is this: There is one and only one person who has the ultimate influence, authority, and veto power over everyone and every-thing in the enterprise, including your sale, and that person is VITO.

/VITO typically has the biggest ego of anyone in the organization. These are the real reasons people don’t want to reach out to VITO!/

# Vito Rule #9: No matter what anyone else in the buying enterprise has to say about some salesperson’s offering, VITO can (and often will) kill that offering on a moment’s notice.
1. *VITO Creates Every Important Initiative:* By definition, an important initiative at VITO, Inc. only becomes important when VITO buys into it. Every critical goal, plan, and objective at VITO, Inc. has VITO’s DNA in it. Others in the organization can feed the suggestion box, but VITO decides what’s hot and what’s not at any given moment.
2. *Constant Improvement is VITO’s Responsibility:* In VITO’s world, status quo doesn’t go. VITOs are measured on the growth of their organizations. Flat, horizontal growth lines just don’t compute for VITO, stakeholders, and shareholders; therefore, they’re on a constant lookout for ideas that no one else has brought to their attention. They have an “early adopter” mentality; they are eager to take the risk to have what no one else has and do what no one else is doing.
3. VITO Owns all Budgets: When your current contact says, “We’ve got to get the budget approved,” who do you think that person goes to for approval? Answer: Either to VITO or to someone who reports, directly or indirectly, to VITO. Once VITO decides to work with you, VITO will allocate sufficient funds to the appropriate decision maker.
4. VITO Knows Who’s Who: VITO not only knows everyone of importance on the org chart, but also (most likely) hand-picked, hired, or held on to everyone on that chart. VITO typically has less than ten direct reports. These individuals are VITO’s movers and shakers, the people who get done whatever VITO wants done. Investing large amounts of your time with anyone else in the enterprise amounts to sales malpractice.
5. VITO Defines the Critical Business Criteria: At VITO, Inc., there are certain critical business criteria that all partners and suppliers must meet or exceed if they want to exchange their goods for VITO’s cold, hard cash. If you and your company can’t meet VITO’s business criteria, you will be dismissed. If you don’t know what the criteria are, you can’t meet them.
6. VITO Gets Paid to Make Decisions: This one’s a no-brainer. You’re a salesperson. Your job is to generate positive decisions from qualified people who have the authority to say yes to mutually beneficial business propositions. VITO’s job is to make decisions that benefit VITO, Inc. This is a match made in heaven! Some others in the enterprise avoid making decisions, but VITO knows that making a decision is the only sure way to get the ball rolling.

What’s driving those decisions? The nine values that drive VITO’s decisions are as follows:

* Competence. VITO’s decision-making actions will typically be based upon experience, reason, and moral principles. There’s an emotional component, too, but VITO is too smart a player not to look at the upsides and downsides.
* Forward-looking vision. VITOs set clear goals and envision the future, then make decisions that match that vision. They know where they’re going. They habitually pick priorities that support their vision.
* Confidence. VITOs displays confidence in all that they do, especially when it comes to making a decision.
* Intelligence. VITOs quickly get access to the background information they need. They are well informed and well connected, and as a result they tend to make good decisions fast.
* Fair-mindedness. VITOs are open-minded and fair. Contrary to popular belief, they are generally sensitive to the feelings, values, interests, and wellbeing of others.
* Broad-mindedness. VITOs instinctively seek out diversity, and in doing so, open up their world of possibilities.
* Honesty. VITOs are straight shooters. They will always tell you where you stand.
* Imagination. VITOs know how to make timely and appropriate changes in their thinking, plans, and methods. They are always on the lookout for new and better ideas and solutions to problems.
* Courage. VITOs don’t spook easily, and they have the per- severance to accomplish a goal, regardless of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles they may face. Specifically, they are not frightened of making the “wrong” decision. When this happens, VITOs simply make another decision and move on!

# Close-Up on the Decision MakerEffective VITO selling does not rule out the involvement of other players at VITO, Inc. All three work at VITO, Inc.; all three are likely to show up at some point in your sales process.

1. The Decision Maker. This is VITO’s direct report.2. “Seemore,” the Influencer. This is a technical/topic expert who typically does not report directly to VITO, but who can derail your sale if you’re not careful.3. The Recommender. This is an end-user or potential end-user of your stuff who typically does not report directly to VITO.

Let’s look now at the members of the most important group on that list: the Decision Makers who are personally accountable to VITO for overachieving on VITO’s vision.

## The Decision Maker
I have yet to meet a VITO who didn’t handpick his or her own direct reports; that is, someone who answers personally to VITO, week in and week out. This elite group ranges from Personal Assistants to the individuals who run the divisions and lines of business that drive VITO, Inc. These handpicked, highly accountable folks are loyal not just to VITO but to VITO’s vision. For the most part, this elite group of direct reports can be gathered into the category I call Decision Makers. They are compensated (quite handsomely, I might add) for the over accomplishment of VITO’s vision and mission. They want to raise the bar, which is why VITO likes having them around.

Decision Makers typically have titles like Line of Business Executive, Director, VP, or CXO. That “X” could stand for just about any-thing: Financial, Technology, Information, Operations, Marketing,

# Good relationships with Decision Makers are critical to your ability to make the sale at VITO, Inc. and to your overall success within the enterprise.
These are sought-after players, and it’s not uncommon for them to move from one company to another in search of greater challenges and greater rewards. Once you earn their trust, they will take you with them wherever they go. This is one huge reason why we must follow the Decision Maker’s example.

# Vito Rule #10: VITO’s Decision Makers get paid to say yes.
Decision Makers are basically “yes” people. That doesn’t mean they’re incapable of thinking for themselves, but it does mean that when they are given a set of goals, plans, and objectives from VITO, they must fulfill. Sure, they can give VITO supportive opinions and information that illustrate options and alternate ways to over accomplish the task.

### Six Rules of Engagement for the Decision Makers VITO Points You Toward
* Celebrate, respect, listen to, and act upon the opinions, perceptions, or advice of any Decision Maker VITO refers you to.
* Focus on tactical issues, not strategic initiatives, whenever you ask the Decision Maker questions.
* Let the Decision Maker do most of the talking. And while he or she is talking, listen carefully and take notes.
* Focus on exchanges that involve reactions, feelings, and responses. Find out how the Decision Maker feels about the job he or she has been given by VITO.
* Make brief, credible, and sincere compliments. Stature and acknowledgment are extremely important to these folks.
* Keep your conversations uncluttered and free of too many details. Stay at the 30,000-foot level and focus on “thumb-nail sketches” of the advantages of what your product, service, and solutions could possibly do for their specific line of business and/or area of responsibility.

> An Important Note on Advantages  > When I say that your discussions with the Decision Maker should focus on advantages, here’s what I mean: An advantage is how you tailor, tweak, modify, customize, and implement whatever you sell to make it relevant and fit perfectly with your prospects’/ customers’ needs. An advantage is not what your product “is” or how it “does” whatever it’s been designed to do. It is, rather, what you will do to ensure that your prospect or customer gets the jump on a) the competition, b) VITO, Inc.’s current way of doing whatever it is doing, or c) both a and b as a direct result of using your stuff.  

# Chapter 6: Influencers and Recommenders
Decision Makers are busy folks. They have lots of meetings to attend, customers and suppliers to entertain, reports to pore over, conference calls to participate in. They can’t do it all on their own, so they gather a group of individuals to do the heavy lifting for them.
*I call the technical experts who help Decision Makers “Seemores.” OR Influencers*

# Vito Rule #11: Influencers can’t buy jack. Never could. Never would. Never will. Period. End of story.
Therefore, if you find yourself in the unhealthy position of trying to sell anything to an Influencer, you should bear in mind that, by continuing down this path, you will get the same result you would if you were trying to teach a pig to sing.

The Decision Makers of the world really do trust and rely upon Seemore to give them an accurate take on all of the possible options open for them to get the job done. 

The Decision Maker tells Seemore to find at least three ways to accomplish the goal by the end of the second quarter (note: that’s early) and to make sure that the supplier can cut 15 percent off the purchase price. 

We call the people Seemore asks for help in assembling a body of data to show to the Decision Maker by a special name: Recommenders.

Think carefully about how your sales process should anticipate and strategize contacts with people in the four levels I’ve outlined: VITO, theDecision Maker, Seemore the Influencer, and the Recommender.

# Make your first call on VITO the Approver.
»» Cover three very important first-call objectives during that call (you’ll be learning exactly how to do that in the chapters thatfollow).»» Qualify this business opportunity (ditto).»» Then, take the shunt to the Decision Maker (you’ll be learning exactly how to facilitate this in the chapters that follow).
»» Then, before you make contact with the Decision Maker, gather some information from either the resources on the web or from a Recommender or two.»» After you build Equal Business Stature with the Decision Maker and position yourself from a business criteria stand-point (you’ll be learning how to do that too!) . . .»» Then and only then, you’ll spend time with Seemore and start building your coalition.

# Vito Rule #12: Follow the perfect sales process.
# Chapter 7: How Not to Communicate with VITO
There is no magic script. There are some broad guidelines for having a great call with VITO—and I’ll cover them in detail with you— but there’s no single speech you can memorize ahead of time and then recite verbatim to get appointments.

# Vito Rule #13: Like VITO, you have to be willing to change course as circumstances demand in order to hit your goal.
##  Something Better Than a Script
The voice-to-voice contact with VITO (which is what most salespeople I work with are scared of) is only part of the equation. It’s an important part, to be sure, but not, by any means, the whole toolkit. 

*I want you to memorize the following list of three classic mistakes. These are the major blunders salespeople usually make when reaching out to VITO, and they apply to verbal, written, and face-to-face communication.*

# Mistake 1: Not Focusing on Benefits
Focusing on benefits means speaking what I call the “language of VITO.” A benefit is an anticipated end result that brings VITO measurably closer to attaining some specific part of his or her vision. The moment you stop communicating about benefits, you will lose VITO.Will what you’re offering increase the shareholder value at VITO, Inc. by one or more of the following familiar results?»» Make VITO money»» Improve efficiency»» Save VITO money»» Keep VITO in compliance

### Connect what you want to say to those benefits! When you stop to think about it, you will realize why it’s so important to speak this kind of language. You want to focus, first and foremost, on the benefit(s) of your products, service, and solutions, and how they will help VITO overachieve goals, plans, and objectives for the near term and in the long range in all areas of VITO, Inc.

The number-one mistake salespeople make when communicating with VITO is not speaking the language of VITO!

## Communicating with the Players at VITO, Inc.> When communicating with VITO, focus on measurable benefits (end result that will match VITO’s goals, plans, and objectives) during a particular period of time.  >   > When communicating with the Decision Maker, focus on advantages (what you will do to tweak, modify, customize, or implement what you sell; how what you sell will provide an edge over the competition, and/or what’s currently being used or the status quo at VITO, Inc.).  
>   
> When communicating with Seemore the Influencer, focus on features (the pieces, parts, and components that make up what your product,  > service, and solution actually is).  >   > When communicating with the Recommender, focus on functions (how people will actually use your product, service, and solution; the stuff you would put in an owner’s manual).  

# Mistake 2: Using Terminology That VITO Doesn’t Understand
This is a direct challenge to VITO’s ego, power, control, influence, and authority. Always introduce your ideas, thoughts, and proposed solutions using words and phrases that VITO is familiar with and will accept.Salesperson on the phone to 
VITO: Ms. Importanta, it looks like our new Cripton generator with its 28mx virtualized software application equalizer will perform with your existing NAP applications while giving you full security against any breach of your relational XT-data base.VITO: Hold on, my assistant will help you. I’ve got more important compliance issues to deal with.*Wrong hymn book! The salesperson was pitching a feature to someone who couldn’t care less about features, using techno-babble and terminology that only Seemore could understand!*

# Mistake 3: Not Respecting VITO’s Time
VITOs live to over accomplish their goals, plans, and objectives ahead of schedule. They divide the world up into two groups: those who keep them from beating the clock and those who help them beat the clock. Which camp would you rather be assigned to?Salesperson on the phone to VITO: What I’d like to do is set up an in-person meeting with all of my team members so we can give you a full briefing.VITO: (Click)*Believe it or not, VITO isn’t looking forward to a full briefing from a group of total strangers. VITO lives in a time-compressed world— and if you stop to think about it, you’ll realize that you do, too.*

> Take another look at those three big mistakes, and memorize them, before you go on to the next chapter!  > Not focusing on benefits  > Using terminology that VITO doesn’t understand   
> Not respecting VITO’s time  

# Chapter 8: Twelve Attitudes and Traits You Must Own to Sell to VITO
When it comes to success in sales, the name of the game is SELLING TO VITO, and the very first thing you will be selling is your own *Equal Business Stature.*

You must maintain Equal Business Stature in all your interactions with VITO, whether they are verbal, written, virtual, or sent up via smoke signals from a distant mountain. You have a right to initiate this relationship. You have a right to support it. You have a right to document the value you have delivered within it.

# Vito Rule #14: What matters is not the title, but the traits you share with VITO.
* I Am Passionate About Life and Business: VITOs enjoy a high emotional state without the use of any substance, stimulant, or exotic New Age “therapies” or “activities.” When VITOs get up in the morning, they picture the world of abundance that awaits, and they’re excited about the opportunity that this day gives them. VITOs are not wishy-washy, indifferent, or doubtful. Their passion touches everything they do, both in their personal life and their business operations. They are grateful for each day.
* I Have Established a Good Work/Life Balance: VITOs know that all work and no play is a train wreck waiting to hap- pen. Sure, it takes a lot of work to be successful in any economy, any market, with any product, service, or solution. However, VITOs know they must recharge their batteries.
* I Am Constantly Expanding My Communication Skills: Are you committed to constantly perfecting your auditory, visual, and kinesthetic communications skills? (I’ll wait here if you need to look those words up . . . okay, welcome back.) Typically, when VITO communicates, you get not just facts, but emotion in their message. They are usually good orators, and most of them can get the point across with pen and paper. When they speak, others listen and they often speak using “word pictures,” in other words they paint pictures that are easy for the listener(s) to see. 
* I Am Curious: If you have children or you’ve spent time around them, you know that they are curious. For a successful VITO, it’s all about being curious in a meaningful (and yes, occasionally childlike) way. 
* I Am Self-Determined: VITOs believe it’s their own responsibility to take control of their own destiny. They determine their own economic development; they have a knack for seeking out business opportunities and making them a personal priority. If you’ve been selling for more than a month, you know you do this, too. VITO’s personal self-determination is the same as VITO’s business determination. VITO is VITO, Inc. 
* I Focus to Completion: The most successful VITOs and their organizations have a habit of completion. Most of the stuff they start gets done. Whether it gets the desired result or fails to make the mark, VITO makes sure it crosses the finish line. Here’s one big reason: VITO writes down goals, plans, and objectives! (You do that, too, right?)
* I Have Integrity: Do you do what you say you’ll do, when you say you’ll do it? It doesn’t matter what the promise is; it could be sending information, returning a call, paying a bill (on time), showing up for an in-person meeting (on time), or returning a book to the library (on time). VITOs are more likely than anyone else in the organization to make sure they actually do what they say they’ll do. If something goes wrong and they aren’t able to follow through on a commitment, they’re the first ones to let you know.
* I Am a Team Player: When I was a salesperson at Hewlett Packard, I was fortunate to win many awards for my sales performance. On those special occasions, I would take the plaque or trophy to a local engraving shop and have the names of my support team emblazoned on the item. Then I would bring it into the office and pass it around to the team members. Not one of those trophies ever made it to my own desk. Here’s my point: My personal observations of VITOs is that they are very good at building a powerful, capable, loyal team . . . and then they go about taking care of that team.
* I Am Optimistic and Upbeat: Notice that VITOs surround themselves with can-do people. There’s a good reason for this: Successful VITOs do not dwell on what’s happening to them, but rather on how to react to what’s happening. That’s a big part of the inner circle’s job: Keeping the focus on what can hap-pen, not on what can’t happen (or what didn’t happen). Smart VITOs never stop asking themselves, “How can I help this person win, and in the process create a win for me and my organization?
*  I Am Interested in Problem Solving: Success in sales requires that you are truly interested in helping some-one solve a problem. The greatest companies in the world, run by the greatest VITOs in the world, know this. Problem solving requires that you be truly interested in the other person and their current and/or future situation, and that you be fully present for every conversation, without prejudice or impatience. 
* I Approach My Life and My Work with a Sense of Purpose: Like VITO, you must be on a mission. VITOs are intentional in their position and purpose; they didn’t just happen to become the CEO. They don’t just show up for work every day. They are absolutely certain about why they’re doing what they’re doing. When you are certain about your purpose, your work effort is more focused, and that focus brings greater results. 
* I Am Resourceful Enough to Dig for the Strategies, Resources, and Answers I Need: VITOs are exceptionally, sometimes miraculously, resourceful. VITOs are able to respond quickly and effectively, especially in difficult situations. They have the ability to be creative in problem solving, to think (and act) outside the box, more or less instantaneously.

> *Ask VITO the Tough Questions!*  > Prove that you have Equal Business Stature. Get in the habit of asking VITO the tough questions. Be prepared to hear a direct answer (one that you may not want to hear). You must be able to respond directly to each and every possible answer you get! For example:  > You: Ms. Importanta, could you see yourself becoming one of our customers by the end of this month?  > VITO: Maybe.  > You: What would it take for you to change your answer from “Maybe” to “Yes”?  

# Chapter 9: The Principles of VITO Marketing
# Vito Rule #15: Selling to VITO (also known as picking up the phone and calling VITO) is marketing, advertising, public relations, and sales all at the same time!

But for now, please forget that Seemore and the Recommender exist. What you’re about to learn will not work with them.### Pulling It All Together
What if we could take your organization’s ads, marketing, PR, and sales pitches, and pull from all that stuff only what is important to VITO? The result would be a one-way ticket to Sales Heaven. Track down the following stuff right now:*When you’re done, you will have the launching platform necessary to create the approach that will allow you to sell to VITO.*

* Step One: VITO is eager to overachieve. These four desired outcomes are common to virtually all VITOs: 1)Increasing revenues and exceeding the projected revenue plan, 2) Increasing efficiencies and effectiveness of:, 3) Cutting and or containing costs and moving away from unpredictable expenses to accurate and forecasted budgets, 4) Staying in compliance and operating well within corporate culture. Now, pull out a yellow highlighter. Take your company’s ads, mar- keting materials, and press releases and highlight the words, phrases, graphs, charts, and anything else that directly relates to the four results listed above for your ideal customer.
* Step Two: Pull out a red pen. Take out the press releases of each of the companies you would like to turn into customers that are a) in your territory and b) in your target niche. Use your red pen to circle or underline the words, phrases, graphs, charts, and captions that relate in any way to the VITO outcomes listed in Step One.
* Step Three: We’re going find out how what you’ve already been delivering to your existing customers can be quantified into one of two important VITO Value categories.
	* Category A: Hard Dollar Value: What specific results, measured in numbers and/or percentages, have you delivered to your existing marketplace(s)/industry(ies) in the areas listed in Step One? For instance, have you been able to increase revenues by some number or percentage? Have you decreased time to market by a certain number of days? Have you cut the time (by some specific number of days) necessary to process Accounts Payables? Have you reduced some fixed expense by a certain percentage?
	* Category B: Soft Dollar Value: What results have you delivered to your existing marketplace(s)/ industry(ies) in the areas that are listed in Step One that you can’t measure with a number and/or a percentage?
»» Greater brand recognition»» Improved employee morale»» Dramatically improved customer services»» Obtaining full compliance with government regulation »» Better community relations
* Step Four: What you’ll need to do now is take your most impressive Hard Dollar Value and your most impressive Soft Dollar Value and create a statement that is the narrative or summary of those two value statements.
* Step Five: Earlier in this chapter I mentioned the word “predisposed” when talking about approaching the VITOs in your sales territory. Now, pull up your current sales forecast and look at the prospects that you’ve already started your sales process with and ask yourself this question:“Would any of the VITOs in these accounts be interested in what I’ve just written?”

## Vito Rule #16: When you create any written correspondence that you want VITO to actually process, you’ll have to make it a fast read. A fast read in VITO’s world means thirty seconds.

When you’re finally on the phone with VITO, you’ll have less than three seconds to break preoccupation and snag the intentional area ofVITO’s brain. You read right: three seconds. If you don’t hit that target, you’ll hear a click and dial tone. When you’re in person with VITO, you’ll have less than thirty seconds of face time to prove that whatever time you’ve asked for will actually be granted.

/“Hello, Ms. Importanta, how are you today? Great . . . hey, did I catch you at a good time? The purpose of my call today is to let you know . . . .”/
*Notice: This person is toast before he or she gets to explain the purpose of the call.*

### You’ll need to get your point across in thirty words or less. You’ll put more effort, care, and attention into those thirty words than most salespeople put into their whole presentation. But the effort will be worth it.

## You will only have three slides to show to VITO.You will only put a maximum of fifteen words on each slide. You will talk for no more than thirty seconds on each slide. You will order your slides as follows:* Slide 1: The results VITO can expect and the “time to value.” (This is the slide you are probably used to putting last. Get usedto the new sequence. VITO needs to see this first.)* Slide 2: The resources VITO must spend . . . be it time, money, and or talent.
* Slide 3: Social proof about who else in a similar industry is achieving similar results and or your guarantee.


## If You Want VITO to Remember Your Message for More Than about Ninety Seconds, Regardless of the Medium You Use to Deliver that Message . . .. . . Then you will concisely cover these four topics, near and dear to VITO’s heart, in this order:»» Revenue»» Effectiveness and efficiencies of all operations»» Cost reduction without compromising quality»» Compliance with government and industry requirementsThese should look familiar. These are the four desired outcomes VITO is always interested in generating.

# Chapter 11: Exponential Revenue Increases
I hold this truth to be self-evident: No matter what you sell, there is no higher-margin business than repeat business from your existing customers.Why? Because add-on business doesn’t have the high cost of acquisition that new business from a prospect has.

## Very interesting that should be copied (story telling)
As a result, you’re about to settle for the smaller deal, whether you know it now or not! You’re headed for a short sale, a small play. You’re on the road *to Sales Hell.*
If you’re pulling a commission check and you want to make more money, I want you to pay very close attention to what follows. As the alumni of my public seminars, private corporate training events, and webinars can attest, the road I’m about to show you is the one that leads directly *to Sales Heaven.* 

/[Mr. Benefito], your team and my team have been [increasing shareholder value/revenues/margins . . . cutting expenses/increasing efficiencies/improving compliance] by an average of [X percent] for the past [Y] years. We strongly suspect that we could create similar or even greater results in your [shipping and receiving, accounting, operations and marketing departments]. How would you suggest we direct our teams to move forward in the next [XX] days to quickly uncover all of the possibilities?/

# Vito Rule #17: VITOs are looking for ways to improve every area of their organization, not just the area you happen to know about and are working with.
/[Mr. Benefito], we have been [increasing revenues/cutting expenses/ increasing efficiencies/improving compliance] for [3 of the top 4] companies in your industry. We strongly suspect that we could create similar or even greater results in your [shipping and receiving, accounting, operations and marketing departments]. How would you suggest we move forward in the next [XX] days to quickly uncover all of the possibilities?/

Now, let’s say for a moment that your message resonated with VITO’s goals, plans, and objectives for VITO, Inc. What do you think would happen? *DT Comment: That’s why you need to pick your dream 100 and study their strategies to understand how to craft the sales pitch.*

* First, use all the information you’ve gathered thus far to create a VITO target list reflecting every current customer relationship where you can, want, and deserve to expand your presence.
* Then, use all the information you’ve gathered thus far about your current prospects to create a VITO target list reflecting every piece of new business you want to win more quickly, easily, and profitably.
* Make a personal commitment to make maintaining and upgradingthese two lists your life’s work!
* Then, turn the page to begin the process of harnessing a force of nature—VITO’s desire to improve VITO, Inc.—to deliver exponential revenue increases for your organization and commission dollars for yourself.


# Chapter 12: Two Rules for Snagging the Intentional Area of VITO’s Brain
# Vito Rule #18: You must know which VITOs to approach . . . and which not to approach.
### Sending a letter to a VITO who has no need (or interest) in what you can do is a total waste of time. Yet each and every day thousands of salespeople make an attempt to get an appointment with a completely unqualified VITO!

To follow Rule 18, you must establish the persona of your best existing customers. That means you would, at a minimum, need to know the answers to the following twenty-four questions.

Questions You Must Be Able to Answer about Your Organization’s Best Customers:

»» What industry/marketplace are they in?»» What products, services, and solutions do they provideto that industry/marketplace?»» What is their competitive ranking within that industry/ marketplace?»» What is the size of their organization (expressed in number of employees, annual revenue, number of locations, or whatever other metric you can measure and apply across the board)?»» How do they create revenue?»» Do they sell directly to that industry/marketplace?»» Are they a local, regional, national, or global provider to that industry/marketplace?»» Do they have a distribution channel?»» Do they have a private label they provide for others to sell? »» What are they doing with what you’ve sold them?»» What hard value have you delivered?»» How are they measuring it?»» How would you measure it?»» What soft value have you delivered?»» How would they describe it?»» How would you describe it?»» What process did they use to buy from you?»» Did they perform an exhaustive survey of the marketplace?»» What was on their list of requirements/specifications?»» Did they shop all competitors?
»» Did they grind you down on price?»» What was the deciding factor(s) on their purchase from you? »» What were the benefit(s) that got them the most excitedabout your products, services, and solution?

- Before you go on, follow through on the promise you made to maintain and update those lists you created at the end of the last chapter.

1. First: Find the prospects that match the persona you just created and highlight them in some impossible-to-ignore way.2. Next: Take the prospects that don’t match your existing customer persona to a “T” and delete them from your sales forecast!Now . . . take the prospects that are still on your sales forecast and quickly find out what VITO’s name is and what his or her Personal Assistant’s name is.

# Vito Rule #19: You must know how to approach VITO.
Why write a letter? Because VITOs are readers. On average, they read twenty books a year. 

The next thing to remember is: Keep it short. Yes, I realize I’m repeating this.

Approach VITO by writing a letter that features:»» Short sentences»» Short paragraphs»» One page with lots of white space»» Common language, simple words and phrases»» No words/phrases or terminology that are unfamiliar to VITO

Each and every part of this correspondence must stand on its own. Each and every part of this correspondence must tie into something VITO loves to do.

### VITOs love to give orders and take actionTherefore, VITO must be able to forward this correspondence to one of the Decision Makers they hold personally responsible for accomplishing whatever it is that you can help VITO, Inc. overachieve.

### VITOs depend upon their Personal AssistantsTherefore, VITO must get a recommendation from the Personal Assistant about this correspondence—or the Personal Assistant must get the letter onto VITO’s radar screen.

### VITO has a unique mindset and unique methodsTherefore, this correspondence must align with everything we have learned about VITO thus far about what VITO likes to do and how VITO likes to do it!

# Chapter 13: The Six Elements of VITO Correspondence
# Vito Rule #20: Every piece of VITO correspondence has six specific parts, each of which must stand on its own but also be logically connected to all the other parts.

### Element One: A Headline
This headline breaks VITO’s preoccupation and earns attention and readership. It’s short, to the point, and will not include words or phrases with which VITO is unfamiliar. The headline is short (less than thirty words), hard hitting, and attention grabbing.

### Element Two: A Tie-In Paragraph
This paragraph is designed to connect the headline to the rest of the correspondence; typically, it introduces some kind of social proof for the claim just made. Social proof is evidence of your track record with other VITOs in a similar or identical industry as the VITO you’re sending this correspondence to.

### Element Three: Benefit Bullets
This is a series of short statements of your abilities in the areas of greatest interest to this VITO. Whenever you are in doubt about what the areas of interest for a given VITO might be, just follow the priority list I’ve already shared with you as your default setting.

1. Increasing top-line revenues2. Increasing the effectiveness of revenue-generating employees, mission-critical employees, and mission-critical processes
3. Cutting expenses4. Becoming fully compliant with any and all government regulations or industry practices

### Element Four: An Ending ParagraphThis is where you state a call to action or introduce some level of suspicion as to what the possibilities could be. You could also invite VITO to engage certain Decision Makers—by name—in this paragraph.

### Element Five: An Action-Oriented Postscript
This is where you’ll put the precise day, date, and time that you’ll be calling VITO. In this postscript, you’ll include the name of VITO’s personal assistant.

### Element Six: A Short Handwritten Note
You will attach this to the back (not the front) of your correspondence.It’s a note to VITO’s personal assistant. You know he or she’s going to be opening up all of VITO’s mail and reading this, right?

### My Favorite Headlines
The most powerful headlines are ones that will catch VITO’s attention and get VITO to think (or say aloud), “How did they do that?” or “I would love to talk with this genius.” Headlines can include a quote from your VITO, which should be easy to get, or one of your existing customer’s VITOs, which is almost as easy to get. 

* The world’s largest electronic manufacturer increased stock value and reduced time-to-market by [63] days while eliminating [$87.9 million in unnecessary inventory]. My team led the way in just [144] days.”
* Further increase shareholder wealth while at the same time achieving greater compliance—in just [144 days]. Here’s the team that helped do it.
/You’re not just sharing a story about increasing shareholder value; you’re sharing a story about increasing shareholder value while at the same time reducing time-to-market and eliminating unnecessary inventory costs./
*This is called a balanced gain equation, and it’s an extremely important part of any benefit you discuss with, or preview for, VITO.*

* “Further improve operational economics, compliance, and globalization capabilities, in just [90 days].”* “Further improve shareholder wealth in the next [six months] by improving revenues while lowering expenses.”* “Further increase shareholder value by more effective operation of revenue-generating assets while cutting up to [31 percent] in fixed cost, in just [6] months.”* “Board Members . . . help create a Center of Excellence, expand service lines and referrals, while improving medical staff recruitment and retention.”* “Reduce hospital mortality up to [29 percent] while cutting critical nursing staff turnover by as much as [33 percent].”* “A ‘top ten’ advertising firm increased net working capital by [$76.5M] while improving office efficiency by [21 percent], in just [three months].These are proven results based upon our repeatable process.”
* “Our business partnership has delivered [$1.4 million] in increased revenue and reduced expenses by [$6 million] annually. We accomplished this for a CEO in your industry.”* “One of the world’s largest electronic manufacturers reduced cycle time by [44 days] while eliminating [$3.1 million] in inventory. They accomplished this within [90 days] of using my team’s ideas.”* “This year, one of the top three U.S. oil companies will increase their margins while reducing operating expenses by [$15,900 per month], as a direct result of my team’s ideas.”* “By taking my team’s advice, a major U.S. automaker increased one division’s revenue by [200 percent] while saving [$457,000 annually].”
* “One of the largest telecommunications companies in America has increased the efficiency and effectiveness of their employees while realizing an annual savings of over [$1,200,444]. How can my teamserve you?”

### My Favorite Tie-In Paragraphs
The best tie-in paragraphs are ones that keep the ball rolling and add a new thought for VITO to process. In some cases, this new thought can provide a segue into Element Three, your benefit bullets.
*WARNING: It’s very important not to repeat anything in your tie-in paragraph that you said in your headline. Repeated words, phrases, and ideas will turn VITO off.*

* “We’ve helped [cut time] and [expense] into extremely effective business tools while enhancing our customer’s ability to [concentrate on core competencies]. We’ve accomplished this in one or more of the following ways:”
* “During the past [12 years], we have worked with [29] [manufacturing companies] collectively, and we’ve been able to[increase mar-gins and shareholder value]. Are any of the following achievements on your list of goals, plans, or objectives for the [first half] of this calendar [year]? If so, the good news is that we have created a proven, repeatable process that we guarantee to deliver results such as:” “While you peruse this correspondence, [12] other [CEOs] in your industry are benefiting from our innovations with [higher margins], [lower expenses], and [greater peace of mind]. Here are [two]additional results we are providing our business partners:”

### My Favorite Benefit Bullets
The best benefit bullets are short and to the point. Here, again, be careful not to repeat anything. 

»» Reduction of annual variable cost by as much as $6.4 million without compromising patient care.»» Up to 30 percent increase in patient billings while maintaining full compliance and fiduciary responsibilities.»» Further improve clinical results including up to 54 percent decrease in hospital mortality.»» Lowering inventory and improving product availability by detecting supply disruptions early and responding with cost- effectiveness in mind.»» Increased revenues of up to [44 percent] per year have been reported by our clients.
»» Discovering and responding to trends that become visible with a deeper understanding of supplier, inventory, and shipment knowledge-based information.»» Protect Market Share—Employee and client satisfaction & retention consistently adds up to better utilization of human assets. Consider what an employee turnover of only [8 per-cent] and customer churn of less than [14 percent] does for top, middle, and bottom-line numbers.»» Greater add-on business potential while reducing expenses by as much as [$258,000] each month!»» Our partnership improves return on assets by actually reducing the asset base while at the same time making the balance of this base perform to extreme levels of efficiency.»» Faster product shipments by as much as [65 days]. Improved net working capital equals increased inventory turns and minimizes lost sales opportunities to competition.»» Customer satisfaction is higher because the information they receive is more accurate, relevant, and timely.

### My Favorite Ending Paragraphs

The ending paragraph is where you want to make a clear call to action or introduce some level of doubt and suspicion about whether you can deliver these kinds of results for VITO, Inc. If you choose the latter option, you’ll be dialing into VITO’s powerful competitive nature, need to win, and desire not to miss out on anything!

* “[Ms. Importanta], the possibility for your company to achieve similar or even greater results is difficult to determine at this point.”
One fact is certain: You are the one person who can initiate the call to action, and together, our team of experts can quickly explore exactly what all the possibilities are.”
* “[Mr. Benefito], what does this have to do with your [financial institute]? Perhaps everything, if you determine that one or more of the results mentioned in this correspondence are relevant to your strategic initiatives for the balance of this [calendar year]. All that’s necessary is for you to consider taking my call.”
* “[Mr. Benefito], it’s obvious you know your institute’s challenges better than anyone does. But what may not be so obvious is how [YOUR COMPANY NAME HERE], the [world leader in business solutions], could help you realize similar or even greater results before the end of the [first half of this year]. If you would like to take the first step, our complete team of [business experts] can quickly determine each and every possibility.”

### My Favorite Action-Oriented Post Scripts

This is the shortest part of your correspondence, but it may well have the greatest impact. Why? You’re including VITO’s Personal Assistant in the conversation, and you’re also taking the initiative by suggesting a specific day, date, and time for your first conversation. Note that both of these steps are mandatory. I call VITO’s Personal Assistant by the gender-neutral name Tommie.

* “P.S. I’ll call your office on [Thursday, May 14, at 9:30 a.m.]. If this is an inconvenient time, please have [Tommie] inform me as to when I should make the call. Or, if you like, you can reach me [Monday or Tuesday between 9:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m.]. I look forward to our conversation.”* “P.S. [Tommie], I’ll plan on calling your office on [Thursday, May 14, at 9:30 a.m.]. If this isn’t a convenient time to have a brief conversation with [Ms. Importanta]. Please call me and let me know.”* “P.S. The topics of this letter may be important to both of our organizations. That’s why I’ll plan on calling your office on [Thursday,May 14. at 9:30 a.m.]. If this is an inconvenient time, please have Tommie inform me as to when I should make the call.”

# My Favorite Handwritten Notes to VITO’s Personal Assistant
Building rapport with Tommie is absolutely critical if you expect to gain access to VITO. By including this personal note, you’ll be quietly and sincerely saluting Tommie’s uniform.

* “[Tommie], your guidance and insights into your enterprise are priceless. As you know, it’s so difficult to find a compassionate ear in our busy day and hectic schedules. I’ll look forward to our conversation on and finding out what you think about the enclosed correspondence. If you would like to change the time I’ve suggested, just give me a call.”* “[Tommie], please take a look at this correspondence and let me know what your thoughts are about the proven ideas we have for the [hospitality] industry. If I’ve selected an inconvenient time for our first conversation, please let me know.”* “[Tommie], we can actually deliver much, much more than is mentioned in this correspondence! So, if it’s okay with you, a quick conversation will help me get on the right track and stay there! If the time that I’ve selected isn’t convenient, please let me know.”

# Chapter 14: Delivering the Message— Your Telephone Opening Statement to VITO
»» Whether you think you can’t or you think you can, you’re right.»» VITOs (no matter how big or small) will take your call. »» VITOs (no matter how big or small) will and sometimesdo answer their own phones.

# Vito Rule #21: It’s okay to make mistakes . . . because none of this is life threatening.
What’s been your experience with using the telephone to contact your prospects? Do you wind up just leaving voice mail messages, getting shunted to a lower-level person, or worse yet, being blocked by a gatekeeper? Does that happen day after day after day?If so, I have four words for you: “Dude, change your process!” Ever wonder what would happen if, instead of doing what you’re

# Chapter 15: What to Do When VITO Picks Up the Phone
We’ll, if you’re prepared with your opening statement, you’re going to have a conversation with VITO. Let’s start by reviewing what VITO will not tolerate from you.

### Twelve Situations VITO Will Not Tolerate1. Long, drawn-out monologues2. Stupid questions that you should already know the answer to3. Uncertainty as to what you want4. Words and phrases that are unfamiliar5. Wasting VITO’s precious time6. Unfamiliarity with VITO’s industry/niche7. Any lack of confidence8. Any kind of BS
9. Ego-based statements of any kind10. Any mention of VITO’s competition11. Any claims without evidence12. Mispronouncing VITO’s name


### VITO’s Two Expectations1. Valuable content. Namely:»» Something VITO doesn’t already know»» Something VITO wants to overachieve»» Something said in a way that VITO easily understands »» Apparent knowledge about VITO’s industry»» Some knowledge about VITO’s company»» Clarity on the outcome you want from the call

2. Confident delivery, including: »» Quick, to-the-point, focusedstatements »» A conversational tone»» You making sure that VITO has plenty of chances to interrupt

You just dialed VITO’s number. You hear one ring, two rings, three rings, and then . . . VITO picks up!VITO will say something darn close to, “This is VITO, how can I help you?”

*Stupid Things You Will Not Say at This Critical Moment*»»“Is this a good time?” 
»»“Do you have a minute? 
»»“I was wondering if . . .”»»“Would you be interested in . . .” 
»»“I was just making some calls . . .” »»“ The purpose of my call is . . .” »»“How are you today?

Instead of any of those dumb things, you’ll say: “Mr. VITO Benefito?”That’s it. That’s all. Stop right there! All you’ll be saying to get the conversation going is VITO’s name.

*Remember, VITO usually isn’t just sitting around waiting for the phone to ring. VITO is busy, and when people are busy, the quickest and most effective way to break the dominant preoccupation is to say the person’s name.*

*Here’s What You’ll Say Next*»»“It’s an honor to finally speak with you . . .” 
»»“Thanks for picking up the phone.” 
»»“Thanks for taking my call.”»»“Thanks for taking the time to talk with me.” 
»»“You’re just the person who’ll appreciate this.”

That’s it. That’s all. Stop right there! What you just delivered is called a pleasantry. Yes, it’s different; yes, it’s brief; and yes, when you say it and pause at the end you give VITO a chance to interrupt you and say something like, “Why do you think it’s an honor to speak to me?” When it happens, it’s a great way to get started building Equal Business Stature with VITO. You could respond with, “Getting to speak with the CEO of an organization that’s had [four consecutive years of double digit growth] is not only an honor but a great opportunity for both of us!”

*Here’s What You’ll Say Next*“The [CEO] of the world’s largest electronic manufacturer increased shareholder value and reduced cycle time by [63] days while eliminating $87.9 million in inventory, in just [144] days.”*That’s it. That’s all. Stop right there!*

So, if you did happen to send your letter, and you happen to be calling at the time you said you would in your P.S., and VITO did happen to pick up the phone, what you’re saying here would remind VITO of the letter that came the other day.That’s a good thing.Once VITO remembers that uniquely written, intriguing letter, VITO is likely to say something like this:VITO: “This sounds familiar. Where did I read this? Did you send me a letter?”You: “Yes, sure did. Mr. Benefito, what did you think of it?”

*If You Don’t Get Interrupted, Here’s What You’ll Say Next*You: “Mr. Benefito, who on your team would you like me to continue this conversation with between now and the end of this business day?”Or:You: “Does this touch on issues that are of concern to you by the end of this [month, year, quarter]?”
You: “Are you interested in similar or even greater results by the end of this [year]?”Or:You: “Is this something that’s consistent with what you’re trying to achieve this [month, year, quarter]?”

*That’s it. That’s all. Stop right there! This is your ending question. At this point, there’s no way that VITO will dismiss you or your offer! Yes, you may get some questions. Yes, you may get shunted to one or more of VITO’s Decision Makers. All of these are outcomes that can lead you to another conversation with VITO—and get you one step closer to a permanent zip code in Sales Heaven!*

»» You didn’t use your name in your opening statement because, until you’re otherwise informed, VITO doesn’t care what your name is! If VITO wants your name, you’ll know.
»» You didn’t ask VITO for anything other than a shunt to one of VITO’s Decision Makers because getting a shunt to a Decision Maker is an important outcome of this call. I’ll show you exactly what to do with that shunt a little later on in the book.

# Chapter 16: Three Obstacles, Eight Steps
In the last chapter, we put together our telephone opening statement, which means we’re ready to deliver a meaningful (and easily inter- rupted) monologue to VITO. This is certainly a critical piece of our approach, but it’s time for a reality check. Before we actually get to deliver that monologue, we may need to navigate three significant potential obstacles. They are:
1. A Receptionist Gatekeeper2. One or more of VITO’s personal assistants (very different from the Receptionist Gatekeeper, as we shall see)3. The possibility of getting stymied by voice mail

*Postal Format*Don’t use your company logo at the top (or anywhere else) of the correspondence or envelope! Yeah, yeah, I know. Your logo is cool and you’ve been doing a lot of advertising lately and you’re sponsor-

By the way, don’t write anything on the outside of the envelope like “Personal and Confidential” or “To be opened by addressee only.”Finally, use an 81⁄2" × 11" or larger envelope for your letter. You want this correspondence to stand out. Use real postage stamps, too— not a postage meter. Please remember, because your VITO correspondence is in a large envelope, it will require some additional postage!

*E-mail Format*Keep it simple! Keep it short!If you’re planning to e-mail the VITO correspondence that we created together a little while back, you’ll have to edit it down. Every-one (including VITO) expects e-mail to be shorter than regular mail. Safety tip: Make sure you put your e-mail version through a spell checker before hitting send!On many e-mail systems, what you create and see on your end may not be what VITO will see on his or her end. If you use any links, make sure they’re tailored for this VITO. And make sure they work

Stay away from catchy one-liners that aren’t in your subject line, such as “Increased revenues and lower expenses with our new Zipline processors.” The subject line should be a short version of your *P.S. It could read like this: *Re: Our conversation on Thursday, May 14, at 9:30 a.m.*


*Step Three: Find Out VITO’s Name for Each of the Prospects in Step Two*

*Step Four: Find Out the Name of VITO’s Personal Assistant*
You’ll need this for two very important reasons. First, to create your P.S. and that special handwritten message. Second, you’ll need this name to interact effectively with the gatekeeper receptionist. 

The fastest and most accurate way to discover VITO’s personal assistant’s name? Call VITO, Inc. and ask!

*Step Five: Find Out VITO, Inc.’s Fax Number*
Why do you need this? Because you’ll be faxing your VITO correspondence to VITO, Inc. one hour before your call to VITO! 

*Step Six: Find the Name(s) of Each of the Decision Makers Who Represent Your Perfect “Shunt” Target*
Which Decision Maker(s) are most likely to be empowered by VITO to take a closer look into your ideas? For example, in my case, that’s the VP of Sales or the CPO (Chief Performance Officer) or CMO (Chief Marketing Officer).

*Step Seven: Internalize Your Telephone Opening Statement*
I didn’t say memorize it; I said internalize it.If you memorize it, it will sound like you’re reading it from a script. When you internalize an opening statement, you’ll never say it the same way twice. “Filler” words (“uh,” “um,” “you know”) are okay in moderation. We’re looking for a casual, relaxed, and much-less-than- perfect delivery.

*Step Eight: Prepare Your Voice Mail Message to VITO*

Yes, I know that you’ve been struggling with voice mail jail. I also know that no one’s been returning your calls. 

# Vito Rule #22: Once you complete all eight of the pre- correspondence steps, and not before, you will be ready to send your VITO correspondence.

# Chapter 17: The Gatekeepers
Before you pick up the phone to call VITO, you must master a few simple facts about Receptionist Gatekeepers. Namely:
»» They are not the highest-paid employees at VITO, Inc.»» Their job is to be polite and route calls as quickly and accurately aspossible to the appropriate individuals at VITO, Inc.»» They are trained to protect the time of key individuals; that means they are trained to pick up on any uncertainty in your voice or what you’re saying.»» They can smell an unsolicited sales call a mile away.

How do you deal with these folks? Let’s make a VITO call and hear what an ideal interaction with a Receptionist Gatekeeper sounds like.

The phone rings. Here’s what happens next.Receptionist Gatekeeper: VITO, Inc., how may I direct your call?You: Please connect me with [Tommie] in [Ms. Importanta’s] office, this is [Will, Will Prosper]. Thank you!VITO RULE When interacting with the Receptionist# Vito Rule #23: Gatekeeper, you must close with the words, “Thank you!” spoken briskly and confidently.
You must give these pieces of information, in this order. The bot-tom line is this: If you follow this sequence, you’re actually doing the Receptionist Gatekeeper’s job for him or her!

Receptionist Gatekeeper: What’s the call about?

*Response 1*You: “[Ms. Importanta] is expecting my call at [9:30]. Would you please put me through? Thank you!”*Repeat: You must close with the words, “Thank you!” spoken briskly and confidently!*
*Response 2*You: “My call to [Ms. Importanta] is about [increasing shareholder value, reducing cycle time and eliminating $87.9 million in inventory]. Now, it appears that I am running a bit late for my call. Would you please connect me to Tommie? Thank you!”*And once again: You must close with the words, “Thank you!” spoken briskly and confidently!*

*VITO’s Personal Assistant, Tommie*Good news! The closer you get to VITO, the easier the process gets.Once the Receptionist Gatekeeper puts your call through to Tommie’s office, one of these three things will take place:1. Tommie will answer the phone2. Voice mail will answer the phone3. VITO will answer the phone

# Vito Rule #23: When talking with Tommie, forget that VITO 
You: “Tommie, thanks for taking my call! This is [Will, Will Prosper, with ZipLine]. The [CEO] of the world’s largest electronic manufacturer increased shareholder value and reduced cycle time by [63] days while eliminating $87.9 million in inventory, in just [144] days. Does this touch on issues that are of concern to you during this[month, year, quarter]?”

*Notice that you are not mentioning VITO!**Notice that you are treating Tommie as though Tommie WERE VITO!*

## Here’s What Will Happen Next
Tommie will make a mental connection about you, your letter, its headline, and your opening statement’s hook, and shortly after doing that will probably answer your question with something that sounds like this:Tommie: “Shareholder value, reducing time to market, and cutting expenses is always important to Ms. Importanta.”
Look at what just happened. You asked if something was important to Tommie, and Tommie replied with what is important to VITO. I have heard this happen hundreds of times. No, make that thousands of times.

### General Rules of Engagement with Tommie P.151
»» Do follow up with a handwritten thank-you note immediately after your first conversation with Tommie. You can also send an e-mail, as long as you also send a nice handwritten note via snail mail.

# Chapter 18: Voice Mail Messages
Voice mail is actually a great and underused sales tool. Most of the people and organizations you’re competing against are not using it effectively. You’re going to begin taking advantage of that fact!# Vito Rule #25: The tone, modulation, and pacing of your voice will determine how easy or difficult it is for VITO to listen to (and act on!) your message.
You: “[Mr. Benefito], this is [Will, Will Prosper] with [ZipLine]— if you were in your office to take my call, this is what you would have heard: The [CEO] of the world’s largest electronic manufacturer increased shareholder value and reduced cycle time by [63] days while eliminating [$87.9 million in inventory], in just [144] days. This topic could be important to both of us. That’s why you’ll be hearing from me again [today] at [1:30], or if you like, you can call me before then at [800-877-8486]. Have a masterful rest of the day!”
