This is the key to Crossing the Chasm. The chasm represents the gulf between two distinct marketplaces for technology products—the first, an early market dominated by early adopters and insiders who are quick to appreciate the nature and benefits of the new development, and the second a mainstream market representing “the rest of us,” people who want the benefits of new technology but who do not want to “experience” it in all its gory details.

Is it not as good—nay, better—than the product that beat us out? How can you say that Oracle is better than Sybase, Microsoft Word is better than WordPerfect, Cisco’s routers are better than Bay Networks’, or that Pentium is better than the Power PC?” How, indeed? For in fact, feature for feature, the less successful product is often arguably superior.

To be specific, the point of greatest peril in the development of a high-tech market lies in making the transition from an early market dominated by a few visionary customers to a mainstream market dominated by a large block of customers who are predominantly pragmatists in orientation. The gap between these two markets, heretofore ignored, is in fact so significant as to warrant being called a chasm, and crossing this chasm must be the primary focus of any long-term

Every truly innovative high-tech product starts out as a fad—something with no known market value or purpose but with “great properties” that generate a lot of enthusiasm within an “in crowd.” That’s the early market. Then comes a period during which the rest of the world watch-es to see if anything can be made of this; that is the chasm. If in fact something does come out of it—if a value proposition is discovered that can predictably be delivered to a targetable set of customers at a reasonable price-then a new mainstream market forms, typically with a rapidity that allows its initial leaders to become very, very successful.

It turns out our attitude toward technology adoption becomes significant—at least in a marketing sense—any time we are introduced to products that require us to change our current mode of behavior or to modify other products and services we rely on. In academic terms, such change-sensitive products are called discontinuous innovations. The contrasting term, continuous innovations, refers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require us to change behavior.

This profile, is in turn, the very foundation of the High-Tech Marketing Model. That model says that the way to develop a high-tech market is to work the curve left to right, focusing first on the innovators, growing that market, then moving on to the early adopters, growing that market, and so on, to the early majority, late majority, and even to the laggards.

From this notion comes the idea of a window of opportunity. If momentum is lost, then we can be overtaken by a competitor, thereby losing the advantages exclusive to a technology leadership position—specifically, the profit-margin advantage during the middle to late stages, which is the primary source from which high-tech fortunes are made.

PC, and its designers were careful to tune its performance specifically for that platform. As a result, the innovators liked Lotus 1-2-3 because it was slick and fast. Then the early adopters liked it because it allowed them to do something they had never been able to do before—what later became popularized as “what if ” analysis. The early majority liked the spreadsheet because it fell into line with some very common business operations, like budgeting, sales forecasting, and project tracking. As more and more people began to use it, it became harder and harder to use anything else, including paper and pencil, so the late majority gradually fell into line. This was the tool people knew how to use. If you wanted to share a spreadsheet, it had to be in Lotus format. Thus it became so entrenched that by the end of the 1980s well over half the IBM PCs and PC compatibles with spreadsheets had Lotus 1-2-3—despite the fact that there were numerous competitors, many of which were, feature for fea- 12 CROSSING THE CHASM ture, superior products.

As you can see, the components of the life cycle are unchanged, but between any two psychographic groups has been introduced a gap. This sym-bolizes the dissociation between the two groups—that is, the difficulty any group will have in accepting a new product if it is presented in the same way as it was to the group to its immediate left. Each of these gaps represents an opportunity for marketing to lose momentum, to miss the transition to the next segment, thereby never to gain the promised land of profit-margin leadership in the middle of the bell curve.

The market-development problem in the case of both neural networking software and desktop video conferencing is this: With each of these exciting, functional technologies it has been possible to establish a working system and to get innovators to adopt it. But it has not as yet been possible to carry that success over to the early adopters. As we shall see in the next chapter, the key to winning over this segment is to show that the new technology enables some strategic leap forward, something never before possible, which has an intrin-sic value and appeal to the nontechnologist.

Simply put, the early majority is willing and able to become technologically competent, where necessary; the late majority, much less so. When a product reaches this point in the market development, it must be made increasingly easier to adopt in order to continue being successful. If this does not occur, the transition to the late majority may well stall or never happen.

The problem is that for people who are not frequent users of the system the protocols are simply too hard to remember. As a result, users do not use the features, and so companies in mature markets find it harder and harder to get paid for the R&D they have done because the end user cannot capture the benefit. Instead, they bemoan that the product has become a commodity when in fact it is the experience of the product that has been commoditized. This truly is marketing’s fault, particularly when companies have ceded marketing the right to redesign the user interface and thus control the user experience.

Despite the fact that it was—and is—a very hot technology, and that it garnered strong sup- High-Tech Marketing Enlightenment 17 port from the early adopters, who saw its potential for using computers to aid human decision making, it has simply never caught on as a product for the mainstream market. Why? When it came time for the early majority to absorb it into the mainstream, there were too many obstacles to its adoption: lack of support for mainstream hardware, inability to integrate it easily into existing systems, no established design methodology, and a lack of people trained in how to implement it. So AI languished at the entrance to the mainstream, for lack of a sustained marketing effort to lower the barriers to adoption, and after a while it got a reputation as a failed attempt. And as soon as that happened, the term itself became taboo.

Unfortunately, getting the last part—the notion that part of what defines a high-tech market is the tendency of its members to reference each other when making buying decisions—is absolutely key to successful high-tech marketing. So let’s make this as clear as possible. If two people buy the same product for the same reason but have no way they could reference each other, they are not part of the same market. That is, if I sell an oscilloscope for monitoring heartbeats to a doctor in Boston and the identical product for the same purpose to a doctor in Zaire, and these two doctors have no reasonable basis for communicating with each other, then I am dealing in two different markets. Similarly, if I sell an oscilloscope to a doctor in Boston and then go next door and sell the same product to an engineer working on a sonar device, I am also dealing in two different markets.

In In Search of Excellence, for example, Peters and Waterman tell the story of the fellow who invented Post-It notes. He just put them on the desk of secretaries, and some of those secretaries just tried them to see if or how they would work. Those secretaries became Post-It note enthusiasts and were an early key in the campaign to keep the product idea alive. Enthusiasts are like kindling: They help start the fire. They need to be cherished for that. The way to cherish them is to let them in on the secret, to let them play with the product and give you the feedback, and wherever appropriate, to implement the improvements they suggest and to let them know that you implemented them.

As a class, visionaries tend to be recent entrants to the executive ranks, highly motivated, and driven by a “dream.” The core of the dream is a business goal, not a technology goal, and it involves taking a quantum leap forward in how business is conducted in their industry or by their customers. It also involves a high degree of personal recognition and reward. Understand their dream, and you will understand how to market to them.

As a buying group, visionaries are easy to sell but very hard to please. This is because they are buying a dream—which, to some degree, will always be a dream. The “incarnation” of this dream will require the melding of numerous technologies, many of which will be immature or even nonexistent at the beginning of the project. The odds against everything falling into place without a hitch are astronomical. Nonetheless, both the buyer and the seller can build successfully on two key principles.

To get an early market started requires an entrepreneurial company with a breakthrough technology product that enables a new and compelling application, a technology enthusiast who can evaluate and appreciate the superiority of the product over current alternatives, and a well-heeled visionary who can foresee an order-of-magnitude improvement from implementing the new application. When the market is unfolding as it should, the entrepreneurial company seeds the technology enthusiast community with early copies of its product while at the same time sharing its vision with the visionary executives.

A second problem: The company sells the visionary before it has the product. This is a version of the famous vaporware problem, based on preannouncing and premarketing a product that still has significant development hurdles to overcome. At best, the entrepreneurial company secures a few pilot projects, but as schedules continue to slip, the visionary’s position in the organization weakens, and support for the project is eventually with-drawn, despite a lot of customized work, with no usable customer reference gained.

Mainstream markets in high tech look a lot like mainstream markets in any other industry, particularly those that sell business to business. They are dominated by the early majority, who in high tech are best understood as pragmatists, who, in turn, tend to be accepted as leaders by the late majority, best thought of as conservatives, and rejected as leaders by the laggards, or skeptics.

Each one of these companies rode a pragmatist wave within a specific market to boost its sales a quantum leap upward. It is crucial, therefore, for any long-term strategic marketing plan to understand the pragmatist buyers and to focus on winning their trust. When pragmatists buy, they care about the company they are buying from, the quality of the product they are buying, the infrastructure of supporting products and system interfaces, and the reliability of the service they are going to get.

Pragmatists tend to be “vertically” oriented, meaning that they communicate more with others like themselves within their own industry than do technology enthusiasts and early adopters, who are more likely to communicate “horizontally” across industry boundaries in search of kindred spirits. This means it is very tough to break into a new industry selling to pragmatists.

On the other hand, once a start-up has earned its spurs with the pragmatist buyers within a given vertical market, they tend to be very loyal to it, and even go out of their way to help it succeed. When this happens, the cost of sales goes way down, and the leverage on incremental R&D to support any given customer goes way up. That’s one of the reasons pragmatists make such a great market.

If high-tech businesses are going to be successful over the long term, they must learn to break this vicious circle and establish a reasonable basis for conservatives to want to do business with them. They must understand that conservatives do not have high aspirations about their high-tech investments and hence will not support high price margins. Nonetheless, through sheer volume, they can offer great rewards to the companies that serve them appropriately.

Novell and Autodesk both made serious marketing errors that jeopardized their mainstream-market leadership positions. Why? Part of the answer has to be that they were thinking with the wrong marketing model. Their decisions showed them to be overly focused on what was going on in early markets and too inattentive to the underdeveloped elements in the mainstream. In particular, they were not paying any attention at all to extending their market share to incorporate more conservatives.

One of the keys in breaking into a new market is to establish a strong word-of-mouth reputation among buyers. Numerous studies have shown that in the high-tech buying process, word of mouth is the number one source of information buyers reference, both at the beginning of the sales cycle, to establish their “long lists,” and at the end, when they are paring down their short ones. Now, for word of mouth to develop in any particular marketplace, there must be a critical mass of informed individuals who meet from time to time and, in exchanging views, reinforce the product’s or the company’s positioning. That’s how word of mouth spreads.

Chemists talk to other chemists, lawyers to other lawyers, insurance executives to other insurance executives, and so one. Winning over one or two customers in each of 5 or 10 different segments—the consequence of taking a sales-driven approach—will create no word-of-mouth effect. Your customers may try to start a conversation about you, but there will be no one there to reinforce it. By contrast, winning four or five customers in one segment will create the desired effect. Thus, the segment-targeting company can expect word-of-mouth leverage early in its crossing-the-chasm marketing effort, whereas the sales-driven company will get it much later, if at all. This lack of word of mouth, in turn, makes selling the product that much harder, thereby adding to the cost and the unpredictability of sales.

So, if we want market leadership early on—and we do, since we know pragmatists tend to buy from market leaders, and our number one marketing goal is to achieve a pragmatist installed base that can be referenced— the only right strategy is to take a “big fish, small pond” approach. Segment. Segment. Segment. One of the other benefits of this approach is that it leads directly to you “owning” a market. That is, you get installed by the pragmatists as the leader, and from then on, they conspire to help keep you there.

For all these reasons—for whole product leverage, for word-of-mouth effectiveness, and for perceived market leadership—it is critical that, when crossing the chasm, you focus exclusively on achieving a dominant position in one or two narrowly bounded market segments. If you do not commit fully to this goal, the odds are overwhelmingly against your ever arriving in the mainstream market.

The key to moving beyond one’s initial target niche is to select strategic target market segments to begin with. That is, target a segment that, by virtue of its other connections, creates an entry point into a larger segment. For example, when the Macintosh crossed the chasm, the target niche was the graphics arts department in Fortune 500 companies. This was not a particularly large target market, but it was one that was responsible for a broken, mission-critical process—providing presentations for executives and marketing professionals.

By tackling this problem, Documentum ensured itself of a strongly committed customer. The commitment did not come from the IT organization, which pragmatically was content to work with its established vendors, making continuous improvements to the existing document management infrastructure. Instead, it came from the top brass who, seeing in Documentum a chance to reengineer the entire process to a very different new end, overruled the in-house folks and demanded that they support the new paradigm. This is a standard pattern in crossing the chasm.

So here is the dilemma. How do you get to universal deployment most rapidly? Chasm-crossing theory says, “Act locally, then globally.” Begin, that is, with high-security Internet-based applications inside closed communities: corporations, financial trading, civil and military intelligence, healthcare information sharing, and the like. Eschew any reader that is not integrated into a PC—the rest of the world will lead in those applications. One attractive form factor is a card reader embedded in a PCMC/A card, able to leverage the broad deployment of PCMC/A slots. Work the intranet to extranet to Internet pattern that is emerging with so many Worldwide-Web-based applications. That is, begin with an internal set of employees, then incorporate trusted partners, then elite customers, and then move out to broader audiences.

The fundamental principle for crossing the chasm is to target a specific niche market as your point of attack and focus all your resources on achieving the dominant leadership position in that segment. In one sense, this is a straightforward market-entry problem, to which the correct approach is well known. First you divide up the universe of possible customers into market segments. Then you evaluate each segment for its attractiveness. After the targets get narrowed down to a very small number, the “finalists,” then you develop estimates of such factors as the market niches’ size, their accessibility to distribution, and the degree to which they are well defended by competitors. Then you pick one and go after it. What’s so hard?

The latter is the marketing promise made to win the sale. The contract does not require the company to deliver on this promise-but the customer relationship does. Failure to meet this promise in a business-to-business market has extremely serious consequences. As the bulk of purchases in this marketplace are highly reference oriented, such failure can only create negative word of mouth, causing sales productivity to drop dramatically.

What was the result of all this focus on a single niche? Early on, the results were underwhelming. In the first year of the program, Lawson’s healthcare revenues doubled, but they still were less than 10% of total revenues. Review showed that the sales force was too thinly spread, and so the company reor-ganized to support a dedicated healthcare unit. In the next year revenues increased to 15% and the following to more than 20%. By mid-1998’s close of fiscal year, healthcare was more than 30% of revenues, and the company had grown in five years from $40 million to $200 million.

All in all this amounts to creating a market. For markets represent more than just a buyer and a seller. They are an ecology of interrelated interests interoperating to create what business schools call value chains. For any company crossing the chasm, fostering the initial partnerships to create the whole product is the equivalent of seeding the value chain, getting it started. Once value starts being generated, the market system becomes self-reinforcing, and the whole product manager’s job then is simply to let go and get out of the way.

Recap: Tips on Whole Product Management Again, in keeping with our intent to recap key ideas at the close of each chapter through a tactical checklist, here are eight tips on whole product management: 1. Use the doughnut diagram to define—and then to communicate—the whole product. Shade in all the areas for which you intend your company to take primary responsibility. The remaining areas must be filled by partners or allies. 2. Review the whole product to ensure it has been reduced to its min-eral set. This is the KISS philosophy (Keep It Simple, Stupid). It is hard enough to manage a whole product without burdening it with unnecessary bells and whistles. 3. Review the whole product from each participant’s point of view. Make sure each vendor wins, and that no vendor gets an unfair share of the pie. Inequities here, particularly when they favor you, will instantly defeat the whole product effort—companies are naturally suspicious of each other anyway, and given any encourage-ment, will interpret your entire scheme as a rip-off. 4. Develop the whole product relationships slowly, working from existing instances of cooperation toward a more formalized program. Do not try to institutionalize cooperation in advance of credible examples that everyone can benefit from it—not the least of whom should be the customers. 5. With large partners, try to work from the bottom up; with small ones, from the top down. The goal in either case is to work as close as possible to where decisions that affect the customer actually get made. 6. Once formalized relationships are in place, use them as openings for communication only. Do not count on them to drive cooperation. Partnerships ultimately work only when specific individuals from the different companies involved choose to trust each other. 7. If you are working with very large partners, focus your energy on establishing relationships at the district office level and watch out for wasting time and effort with large corporate staffs. Conversely, if you are working with small partners, be sensitive to their limited resources and do everything you can to leverage your company to work to their advantage. 8. Finally, do not be surprised to discover that the most difficult partner to manage is your own company. If the partnership really is equitable, you can count on someone inside your company insisting on taking a bigger share of the benefit pie. In fighting back, look to your customers to be your truest and most powerful allies.

That’s how competitions work in the early market. It is not at all how they work in the mainstream, in part because there are not enough visionaries to go around, in part because visionaries themselves like to play not in the mainstream but rather out in front of it. Now we are in the true domain of the pragmatist. In the pragmatist’s domain, competition is defined by comparative evaluations of products and vendors within a common category.

There are four domains of value in high-tech marketing: technology, product, market, and company. As products move through the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, the domain of greatest value to the customer changes. In the early market, where decisions are dominated by technology enthusiasts and visionaries, the key value domains are technology and product. In the mainstream, where decisions are dominated by pragmatists and conservatives, the key domains are market and company. Crossing the chasm, in this context, represents a transition from product-based to market-based values.

Similarly, skeptical generalists may not take an interest in an unproven company but are always interested in new market developments.

Silicon Graphics was able to bring to this market a radically discontinuous innovation: If the image you want is not on the film, put it there! This is the magic of digital editing, its trump card over traditional analog methods. There is simply no way the traditional vendors could match it. As a result, they made perfect market alternatives. Referencing them made clear who was Silicon Graphics’ target customer and what was the compelling reason to buy. It made clear what the whole product would have to be, what trade shows the company would have to go to, and what kind of people they would have to seek out as partners and allies.

Unfortunately for Intuit, there was no established mainstream category called computer-aided bill paying. Pragmatists used checkbooks, thank you very much, and they worked just fine. So how could Intuit penetrate this market? First, they had to find a manageable market segment. In this case, the world was already pretty well restricted by the qualifier, adults who use computers in their home. The key issue then became checks—if Quicken were to be easier than a manual system, it had to be easy to get the checks. Intuit decided to handle that process for their end user. (As a result, today, income from providing checks is a key component of the company’s business strategy, the margins being excellent and the cost of sales virtually nil.)

In sum, to the pragmatist buyer, the most powerful evidence of leadership and likelihood of competitive victory is market share. In the absence of definitive numbers here, pragmatists will look to the quality and number of partners and allies you have assembled in your camp, and their degree of demonstrable commitment to your cause. The kind of evidence this buyer is looking for is signs of comarketing, such as joint sales calls and cross-referencing each other’s products in sales literature, and consistent mutual support even when the other party is not present in the room.

The goal of a whole product launch campaign, overall, is to develop relationships in support of a positive word-of-mouth campaign for your company and products. The first thing to remember is that developing these relationships takes time—time to ferret out who are the key influencers, time to get to know them on more or less equal footing, time to get up to speed on the industry issues so that the relationship is pertinent and valuable to both parties. The other thing to remember is that, once these relationships are in place, they represent a major barrier to entry for any competitor.

Historically, the most consistently successful channel in high tech has been the direct sales force. More than anything else, it was IBM’s mastery of this medium that drove it to prominence, and then dominance, in the 1960s and 1970s. Other companies have successfully copied this act, be they DEC and HP for mid-range systems, Oracle and Computer Associates for systems software, SAP and PeopleSoft for enterprise application software, or Cisco and Ascend for networking hardware. The direct sales force is optimized for creating demand. At its center is a consultative salesperson who works with the client in needs analysis and then, supported by a team of application and technology specialists, develops and proposes solutions, which, after additional interaction with the customer, and a competitive procurement, turn into purchase orders. This is a very expensive way to sell, with the cost of sales built into the product’s price.

One underlying point here is that there is a price point below which this method of distribution cannot work.

This has been further exacerbat-ed by the rise of NT, displacing the Unix servers at the low end and beginning to move upstream, further commoditizing the platform and driving out the opportunity to preserve product margins through proprietary differentiation. As price points lower, it becomes increasingly difficult to sell through a direct sales force.

It is certainly possible for a company to create outstanding early market success and not have any significant kind of sales force management capability. Indeed, such capabilities may be countercultural to the firm. If such is the case, then setting out to build a direct sales force can be a very dangerous proposition. An all too typical failed scenario begins with bringing in one or more high-priced, highly ambitious sales executives, who, in trying to create a winning sales situation, run roughshod over the existing culture, politicize the management environment, create divisiveness both within the executive staff and between that group and its investors, and, in general, reduce the effectiveness of the team just at the time when it is being most challenged.

Now because this product will ultimately end up in retail, there’s an upper limit to its price point, typically a few thousand dollars for a consumer up to perhaps $10,000 for a small business owner. Beyond that point, demands for service and other elements of the whole product simply exceed the retail channel’s ability to supply. This leads us to notice an extremely significant discontinuity in the spectrum of channel choices—the space between the high end of retail, say $10,000, and the low end of direct sales, say $75,000.

The first perspective to set on pricing is the customers’, and, as we noted in the section on discovering the chasm, that varies dramatically with their psychographics. Visionaries—the customers dominating the early market’s development—are relatively price-insensitive. Seeking a strategic leap forward, with an order-of-magnitude return on investment, they are convinced that any immediate costs are insignificant when compared with the end result. Indeed, they want to make sure there is, if anything, extra money in the price, because they know they are going to need special service, and they want their vendors to have the money to provide it. There is even a kind of prestige in buying the high-priced alternative.

Being priced to sell means that price does not become a major issue during the sales cycle. Companies crossing the chasm, coming from success in the early market with visionary customers, typically have their products priced too high. Price does become an issue with the pragmatist customer, but when the channel feeds back prospect resistance and uses comparable products as evidence of the expected pricing, companies too often argue that they have no such competition, and that the channel does not know how to sell the product properly.

If we put all these perspectives together and look at them in a crossing-the-chasm context, the fundamental pricing goal should be as follows: Set pricing at the market leader price point, thereby reinforcing your claims to market leadership (or at least not undercutting them), and build a disproportionately high reward for the channel into the price margin, a reward that will be phased out as the product becomes truly established in the mainstream, and competition for the right to distribute it increases.

The great benefit of adopting the discipline of profitability at the outset is that you do not have to learn it later on. All too frequently, even when they are led by experienced managers, enterprises that are funded for long periods of time fall into a “welfare state mentality,” losing their sense of urgency, and looking for their next paycheck to come from yet another round of financing instead of from the marketplace. Moreover, the discipline of profitability teaches you to “just say no” early and often. For most ideas there simply isn’t any money to fund them.

The enterprise is forced to focus drastically just because of resource constraints. This radically reduces time to market because people are not focused on doing something else and because they understand it is the market that is paying their paychecks.

Once early market leadership has been established, however, the entire equation changes. The whole product investment— securing the partnerships and alliances and then making them work to deliver the final goods—takes a significant number of funded initiatives. So does the channel development process, both on the pull and on the push sides, creating demand and providing incentives for sales. And it is critical during this period to have an effective communications program, including press relations, market relations, and advertising. In sum, this is when you want to spend your money—not before.

It is critical, therefore, that as the enterprise shifts from the product-centric world of the early market to the market-centric world of the mainstream, that pioneer technologists be transferred elsewhere—ideally, into another project within the enterprise, but if necessary, to another company.

The key to leaving the chasm behind, however, is to stop custom developments and institutionalize the whole product, to build to a set of standards that the marketplace as a whole can support.

Pioneers do not want to settle down. That is not in their best interest nor in the interest of the companies that employ them. If, at the beginning of the process, everyone can acknowledge this fact, and acknowledge that the very goal of pioneers, the final manifestation of their success, is to create a mainstream market and thereby put themselves out of a job,

Nonetheless, settlers do take over the employment roster, and the management positions and the authority and, ultimately, the budget. And they build fences and create laws (called procedures) and do all the things that created range wars between pioneers and settlers back in the Old West. All this bodes well for the postchasm marketplace, populated with pragmatists, who like reliable, predictable people and abhor surprises.

the pioneer salesperson is still in the picture, still has the relationship with the visionary, but that the day-to-day operation of the account is entirely in others’ hands. This is typically just fine with the pioneer, for he recognizes this to be the kind of detail-oriented settler work for which he has no liking.

A product marketing manager is always a member of the marketing organization, never of the development group, and is responsible for bringing the product to the marketplace and to the distribution organization. This includes all of the elements on the crossing-the-chasm agenda, from target-customer identification through to pricing. It is a highly externally focused job.

the mainstream market emerges, as the needs of this market can be increasingly identified through market research and customer interviews, then the whole product manager steps into the title that she has had all along on her business card, product marketing manager. To try to take this step earlier in the market development cycle is foolish. During the early market it is important to be product-driven and to give strong powers to the product manager.

To sum up, at the beginning of the chasm period, the organization is dominated by pioneers, with strong powers invested in a few top-gun salespeople and product managers. By the time we are into the mainstream market, that power should be distributed far more broadly among major account managers, industry marketing managers, and product marketing managers. This gradual dissemination of authority will ultimately frustrate the pioneer contributors, hampering their ability to make quick decisions and rapid responses. Ultimately, it will make them want to leave.

Compensation for the pioneer salesperson should have the opposite characteristics. It should provide the bulk of its rewards immediately, in recognition of a single key achievement—winning the account.

Taking all this together, the situation argues for a bonus-based program more than a straight commission approach—something lucrative for the salesperson, event-driven and over and done with relatively quickly, and not so closely tied to revenue recognition that either the pioneer has to overstay his or her welcome in order to reap the rewards or earns an extraordinary cash reward at a time when the company simply cannot afford that sort of outlay.

Thus, should that product become a mainstream market hit, they feel they should get a major share of the gains. The fact is, they don’t, and the truth is, bluntly, they don’t deserve it either. Mainstream success, as we have argued at length, is a function of the whole product, not the core product, and that is a very large team effort indeed.

At the outset of this book, we set crossing the chasm as the fundamental marketing priority in high tech. In the middle we established that institutionalizing the whole product was the fundamental strategy for succeeding in this endeavor. It is fitting, therefore, to finish up with a look at the impact of whole product marketing on long-term R&D.

It penetrates not into protons and processes but rather into habits and behaviors. It does not, like the captain of the starship Enterprise, “go where no man has gone before,” but rather, like T. S. Eliot, finds the end of all its exploring is “to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.” It prefers to assemble its creations from existing technologies and products rather than to invent new ones from scratch. Its heroes are less like Einstein, who developed a whole universe out of his own head, and more like George Washington Carver, who discovered over three hundred different uses for the peanut.

Not very heady stuff. No wonder it is so often ignored. Indeed, the word that high tech uses for whole product R&D is maintenance. And the people they assign to it are… well, the janitorial types. No top guns want to go near this stuff.

Instead, the top guns rush out to create more discontinuous innovations, flooding the market with far more technology than it can possibly absorb, and complaining all the while about how product life cycles are becoming shorter and shorter. They play the game, in other words, almost entirely to the left of the chasm, cycling though endless repetitions of early markets that never cross over to the mainstream.

As innovation becomes increasingly continuous, focus groups, which are virtually useless in guiding the development of an early market, become effective tools. The reason they are now effective is that the fundamental product proposition is already in the market and absorbed. Until this is the case, consumers are way over their head in trying to anticipate the value and usage of a new high-tech product. But once that proposition is in place, the tool becomes effective.

To begin with, we had to target the point of attack, which meant isolating our target customers and their compelling reason to buy. Then we had to assemble the invasion force, constructed around the whole product and the partners and allies needed to make it a reality. The next step was to define the battle, by creating our competition and positioning ourselves, in that context, as being easy to buy. Finally, we had to launch the invasion, selecting our intended distribution channel and setting our pricing to give us motivational leverage over that channel.
