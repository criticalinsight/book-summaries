P.15 As a result, many entrepreneurs take a “just do it” attitude, avoiding all forms of management, process and discipline. Unfortunately, this approach leads to chaos more often than it does to success. I should know: my first startup failures were all of this kind. 

P.20 The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build - the thing customers want and will pay for - as quickly as possible. 

P.27 A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty. 

P.49 I’ve come to believe that learning is the essential unit of progress for startups. The effort that is not absolutely necessary for learning what customers want can be eliminated. I call this validated learning because it is always demonstrated by positive improvements in the startup’s core metrics. As we’ve seen, it’s easy to kid yourself about what you think customers want. It’s also easy to learn things that are completely irrelevant. Thus, validated learning is backed up by empirical data collected from real customers. 

P.57 It begins with a clear hypothesis that makes predictions about what is supposed to happen. It then tests those predictions empirically. Just as scientific experimentation is informed by theory, startup experimentation is guided by the startup’s vision. The goal of every startup experiment is to discover how to build a sustainable business around that vision. 

P.61 The value hypothesis tests whether a product or service really delivers value to customers once they are using it. What’s a good indicator that employees find donating their time valuable? We could survey them to get their opinion, but that would not be very accurate because most people have a hard time assessing their feelings objectively. Experiments provide a more accurate gauge. What could we see in real time that would serve as proxy for the value value participants were gaining from volunteering? We could find opportunities for a small number of employees to volunteer and then look at the retention rate of those employees (retention rate of the product, do they use the product again and again?)

P.62 Next, using a technique I call the concierge minimum viable product, Caroline could make sure the first few participants had an experience that was as good as she could make it, completely aligned with her vision. 

P.75 Many people have professional training that emphasises one element of this feedback loop. For engineers, it’s learning to build things as efficiently as possible. Some managers are experts at strategising and learning at the whiteboard. Plenty of entrepreneurs focus their energies on the individuals nouns: having the best product idea or the best-designed initial product or obsessing over data and metrics. The truth is that none of these activities by itself is of paramount importance. Instead , we need to focus our energies on minimising the total time through this feedback loop. 


P.84 What differentiates the success stories from the failures is that the successful entrepreneurs had the foresight, the ability, and the tools to discover which parts of their plans were working brilliantly and which were misguided, and adapt their strategies accordingly.

P.86 In my Totoya interviews, when I asked what distinguishes the Toyota Way from other management approaches, the most common first response was genchi gembutsu - whether I was in manufacturing, product development, sales distribution, or public affairs. You cannot be sure you really understand any part of any business problem unless you go and see for yourself firsthand. It is unacceptable to take anything for granted or to rely on the report of other. 

P.93 A minimum viable product (MVP) helps entrepreneur start the process of learning as quickly as possible. It is not necessarily the smallest product imaginable, though; it is simply the fastest way to get through the build measure learn feedback loop with the minimum amount of effort. 

P.94 IMVUs future path. As you’ll see in Chapter 7 we were able to validate two of our leap-of-faith assumptions: IMVU was providing value for customers and we had a working engine of growth. 

P.99 Our beta waiting list went from 5,000 people to 75,000 people literally overnight. It totally blew us away. Today, Dropbox is one of  Silicon Valley’s hottest companies, rumoured to be worth more than 1$ billion. In this case, the video was the minimum viable product. The MVP validated Drew’s leap-of-faith assumption that customers wanted the product he was developing not because they said so in a focus group or because of a hopeful analogy to another business, but because they actually signed up. 

P.107 In a startup, this is a risky assumption to make. Often we are not even sure who the customer is. Thus, for startups, I believe in the following quality principle: If we do not know who the customer is, we do not know what quality is. Even a “low-quality” MVP can act in service of building a great high-quality product. Yes, MVPs sometimes are perceived as low-quality by customers. If so, we should use this as an opportunity to learn what attributes customers care about. This is infinitely better than mere speculation or whiteboard strategising because it provide da solid empirical foundation on which to build future products. 

P.109 MVPs require the courage to put one’s assumptions to the test. If customers react the way we expect, we can take that as confirmation that our assumptions are correct. If we release a poorly deigned product and customers (even early adopters) cannot figure out how to use it, that will confirm our need to invest in superior design. But we must always ask: what if they don#t care about design in the same way we do?

P.110 As you consider building your own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature, process or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you seek. 

P.112 The solution to this dilemma is a commitment to iteration. You have to commit to a locked-in agreement - ahead of time - that no matter what comes of testing the MVP, you will not give up hope. Successful entrepreneur do not give up at the first sign of trouble, nor do they persevere the plane right into the ground. Instead, they posses a unique combination of perseverance and flexibility. The MVP is just the first step on a journey of learning.  Down that road - after many iterations - you may learn that some element of your product or strategy is flawed and decide it is time to make a change, which I call a pivot, to a different method for achieving your vision. 

P.114 Most products even the ones that fail - do not have zero traction. Most products have some customers, some growth, and some positive results. One of the most dangerous outcomes for a startup is to bumble along in the land of the living dead. 

P.117 Innovation account works in three steps: first, use a minimum viable product to establish real data on where the company is right now. Without a clear-eyed picture of your current status-no matter how far from the goal you may be-you cannot begin to track your progress. 

Second, startups must attempt to tune the engine from the baseline toward the ideal. This may take many attempts. After the startup has made all the micro changes and product optimisations it can to move its baseline toward the ideal, the company reaches a decision point. That is the third step: pivot or persevere. 

If the company is making good progress toward the ideal, that means it’s learning appropriately and using that learning effectively, in which case it makes sense to continue. If not, the management team eventually must conclude that its current product strategy is flawed and needs a serious change. When a company pivots, it starts the process all over again, reestablishing a new baseline and then tuning the engine from there. The sign of a successful pivot is that these engine-tuning activities are more productive after the pivot than before. 

P.135 What Farb and his team didn’t realise was that Grockit’s progress was being measured by vanity metrics: the total number of customers and the total number of questions answered. That was what as causing his team to spin its wheels; those metrics gave the team the sensation of forward motion even though the company was making little progress. What’s interesting is how closely Farb’s method followed superficial aspects of the Lean Startup learning milestones: they shipped an early product and established some baseline metrics. They had relatively short iterations, each of which was judged by its ability to improve customer metrics. 

P.137 Split testing also helps teams refine their understanding of what customers want and don’t want. Grockit’s team constantly added new ways for their customers to interact with each other in the hope that those social communication tools would increase the products value. Inherent in those efforts was the belief that customers desired more communications during their studying. When split testing revealed that the extra features did not change customer behaviour, it called that belief into question. 

P.149 Everything that has ben discussed so far is a prelude to a s seemingly simple question: are we making sufficient progress to believe that our original strategic hypothesis is correct, or do we need to make a major change? That change is called a pivot: a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy and engine of growth. 

P.150 Startup productivity is not about cranking out more widgets or features. It is about aligning our efforts with a business and product that are working to create value and drive growth. In other words, successful pivots put us on a path toward growth a sustainable business. 

P.154 David decided to undertake what I call a zoom-in pivot, refocusing the product on what previously had been considered just one feature of a larger whole. Think of the customer comments above: customers like the concept, they like the voter registration technology;, but they aren’t getting value out of the social networking part of the product. 

P.156 David pivoted again. This time, rather than rely on activists to pay money to drive contacts, he wen to large organisations, professional fund-raisers and big companies, which all have a professional or business interest in political campaigning. The companies seemed extremely eager to use and pay for David#s service, and David quickly signed letters of intent to build the functionality they needed. In this pivot, David did what I call a customer segment pivot, keeping the functionality of the product the same but changing the audience focus. He focused on who pays: from consumers to businesses and nonprofit organisations. In other words, David went from being a business-toconsumer company to being a business-to-business company. In the process he changed his planned growth model, as well to one where he would be able to fund growth out of the profits generated from each B2B sale. 

David decided to reduce staff and pivot again, this time attempting what I call a platform pivot. Instead of selling an application to one customer at a time, David envisioned a new growth model inspired by Googles Adwords platform. He built a self-serve sales platform where anyone could become a customer with just a credit card.

P.160 The true measure of runway is how many pivots a startup has left: the number of opportunities it has to make a fundamental change to its business strategy. Measuring runway through the lens of pivots rather than that of time suggests another way to extend that runway: get to each pivot faster.

P.168 This data informed the pivot or persevere meeting. With everyone present, the team debated what do do with its future. The current strategy wasn’t working, but many employees were nervous about abandoning the online game. After all, it was an important part of what they had signed on to build. They had invested significant time and energy building and supporting those customers. It was painful-as it always is-to realise that that energy had been wasted. 

P.172 A catalog of pivots: 
* Zoon-in pivot
* Zoom-out pivot
* Customer segment pivot
* Customer need pivot
* Platform pivot
* Business architecture pivot
* Value capture pivot
* Engine growth pivot
* Channel pivot
* Technology pivot

P.177 A pivot is better understood as a new strategic hypothesis that will require a new minimum viable product to test. 

P.188 This back to the example of envelope stuffing. What if it turns out that the customer doesn’t want the product we’re building? Although this is never good news for an entrepreneur, finding out sooner is much better than finding out later. Working in small batches ensure that a startup can minimise the expenditure of time, money, and effort that ultimately turns out to have been wasted. 

P.189 Instead of working in separate department, engineers and designers would work together side by side on one feature at a time. Whenever that feature was ready to be tested with customers, they immediately would release a new version of the product, which would go live on our website for relatively small number of people. The team would be able immediately to assess the impact of their work, evaluate its effect on customers, and decide what do to next. For tiny changes, the whole process might be repeated several times per day. In fact, in the aggregate IMVU makes about fifty changes to its product (on average) every single day.

P.192 The essential lesson is not that everyone should be shipping fifty times per day but that by reducing batch size, we can get through the build measure learn feedback loop more quickly than our competitors can. The ability to learn faster from customers is essential competitive advantage that startups must posses.

P.198 Large batches tend to grow over time. Because moving the batch forward often results in additional work, rework, delays, and interruptions, everyone has an incentive to do work in ever-larger batches, trying to minimise this overhead. This is called the large-batch death spiral because, unlike in manufacturing, there are no physical limits on the maximum size of batch. It is possible for batch size to keep growing and growing. Eventually, one batch will become the highest-priority project, a “bet the company” new version of the product, because the company has takes such as long time since the last release.

P.201 As was mentioned earlier, this ins not the way the Lean Startup model works, because customers often don’t know what they want. Our goals in building products is to be able to run experiments that will help us learn how to build a sustainable business. Thus, the right way to think about the product development process in a lean startup is that it is responding to pull requests in the form of experiments that needed to be run. As soon as we formulate a hypothesis that we want to test, the product development team should be engineered to design and run this experiment as quickly as possible, using the smallest batch size that will get the job done. 

P.218 IMVU is a case in point. Our customers were not considered very lucrative by other online services: they included a lot of teenagers, low-income adults, and international customers. Other services tended to assume those people would not pay for anything online. At IMVU, we developed techniques for collecting online payments from customers who did not have a credit card, such as allowing them to bill to their mobile phones or send us cash in the mail. Therefore, we could afford to pay more to acquire those customer than our competitors could. 

P.218 However, in my experience, successful startups usually focus on just one engine of growth, specialising in everything that is required to make it work. companies that attempt to build a dashboard that includes all three engines tend to cause a lot of confusion because the operations  expertise required to model all these effects simultaneously quite complicated. Therefore, I strongly recommended that startups focus on on engine at a time. 

P.221 A startup can evaluate whether it is getting closer to product/market fit as it tunes its engine by evaluating each trip through the Build measure learn feedback loop using innovation accounting. What really matter is not the raw number or vanity metrics but the direction and degree of progress.

P.227 We saw an example of speed regulation in Chapter 9 with the use of the andon cord in systems such as continuous deployment. It is epitomised in the paradoxical Toyota proverb, “Stop production so that production never has to stop.” They key to the andon cord is that it brings work to a stop as soon as an uncorrectable quality problem surfaces - which forces it to be investigated. This is one of the most important discoveries of the lean manufacturing movement: you cannot trade quality for time. 

P.230 At the root of every seemingly technical problem is a human problem. Five Whys provides an opportunity to discover what that human problem might be. Taiichi Ohno gives the following example: When confronted with a problem, have you ever stopped and asked why five times? It is difficult to do even through it sounds easy.

P.248 Organisation have muscle memory, and it is hard for people to unlearn old habits.

P.256 Shusa are often called heavy-wight project managers in the US literature, but this name understates their real roles as design leaders. Toyota employees translate the term as chief engineer, and they refer to the vehicle under development as the shusa’s car. They assured us that the shusa has final, absolute authority over very aspect of vehicle development.

P.263 Whenever possible, the innovation team should be cross-functional and have a clear team leader, like the Toyota shusa. It should be empowered to build, market, and deploy products or features in the sandbox without prior approval. It should be required to report on the success or failure of those efforts by using standard actionable metrics and innovation accounting.

P.276 As Peter Drucker said, “There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all”
