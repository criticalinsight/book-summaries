But I also learned from my father’s experience that although there was virtue in working hard, being willing to do so was no guarantee of having work.Read more at location 111   

IT’S NOT JUST PEOPLE WHO MAKE MISTAKES. Societies and cultures can make mistakes too. I first learned that observing my father.Read more at location 125   

These mistakes are usefully thought of in terms of “fallacies”:Read more at location 126   

The Tech Fallacy says it’s all about the tech. Tech is the be-all and end-all of what we do. Get the tech right and the rest will follow. This belief is deeply, badly wrong—as I first discovered in my teens.Read more at location 138   

But this was a different era of telecommunications, before cell phones. Landline calls within your local area were free, but long-distance calls were expensive. So if the BBS was locally-based, you could dial in for free; if it was further away, the cost would quickly get prohibitive – especially as downloads could take hours. This created a market for more locally available software—a shareware broker. Local bulletin boards would set up to fill this market gap by downloading shareware from a distant BBS and providing it to local users for a subscription fee.Read more at location 179   

Most of these subscription bulletin boards provided a minimal free allowance to nonsubscribers, and because there was often more than one BBS within your toll-free zone, it was possible to seek out and trade shareware between boards. It was a classic network effect, with shareware spreading rapidly and efficiently at very low cost.Read more at location 184   

I added a notice to the BBS that came up upon login that said I would accept donations. In June 1991, I got my first check in the post for $20. I thought it would be the first $20 of $120,000. But it turned out to be one of the only checks I received. And it took me another year, and the onset of puberty, to realize that the distant BBS in Sacramento had another section in its files area—one I hadn’t previously discovered. This wasn’t freeware. It was photos. Lots and lots and lots of photos. Salacious, compromising, illicit photos. There were even a few with crude, jiggly animations of bits bobbing to and fro. The clue was in the ad, but I had missed it. I had thought the “XXX” was just some elementary formatting.Read more at location 194   

Selling porn taught me about the Tech Fallacy. I had believed that building great technology must mean that you’re building a great business. That it was all about the tech. But selling porn taught me that the raison d’être for any business is to give the customer what he wants. He doesn’t want the tech; he wants what the tech can deliver. The tech is just the means to an end.Read more at location 238   

Take two rival companies. Each is armed with $1 million in investments. One spends $900,000 on its technology development, with $100,000 reserved for going to market (i.e., customer development, sales, and marketing). The other spends $100,000 on technology and $900,000 on going to market. Who wins? The market-driven one does. It’s not the better product that wins; it’s the product that best knows how to reach its market. If a thriving company made you its CEO and you decided to let go of its sales and marketing divisions to focus more on the technology, the board would fire you. But walk into almost any two-year-old funded startup, and you’ll see a growing development team budget and a speck, if any, allotted to sales and marketing. Imagine an upstart competitor trying to challenge an entrenched leader without a sales and marketing division—it would be like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest.Read more at location 245   

Yet in the startups that I encounter, if the company has a team of ten, there’ll be nine developers and just one person who is business driven. Contrast that with companies that have gone public: you’ll see ninety salespeople for ten developers.Read more at location 258   

This perception created a pendulum swing: today, the emphasis in the startup market is often on developing innovative, hardcore technology, with a consequent failure to consider other crucial (maybe more crucial) aspects of the business.Read more at location 267   

But the winners will be those who build the best businesses, not the best tech.Read more at location 271   

So when we set up companies, we do it as a team. Which can be awesome—until things go wrong. The Democracy Fallacy is the belief that everything is awesome when you’re part of a team; or, more prosaically, that team members should have an equal say—and stake—in your venture.Read more at location 280   

Businesses need leadership. Leaders need to be rewarded. All the more so in youthful startups.Read more at location 287   

THE DEMOCRACY FALLACY REVISITED Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg… None of them ever found themselves agonizing over team conflict. Perhaps that was because they were all college dropouts. They weren’t trying to build great peer environments where everyone could thrive together. These founders didn’t get fully baked into the “equal equity” tendencies that I found myself (and other founders) mired in. Or maybe they just had an astute and aggressive internal compass for leadership. Sharing power and trying to make everyone happy diminishes the ability to take bold risks and make bold decisions.Read more at location 364   

This was only possible because of the single-minded focus of Jobs’s leadership: no committee would ever have let the Shuffle come to market in such a competitive environment. Under a company that subscribed to the Democracy Fallacy, this simply wouldn’t have been allowed.Read more at location 378   

If you find yourself down the path to forming a company with equal shareholders, here’s a good question to ask of each of the team: can they leave, and the business survive? Whose departure would cause the company to collapse?Read more at location 386   

There needs to be a primus inter pares—a first among equals. And that role is not merely a title or a casting vote if there’s a tie. That role is the boss.Read more at location 397   

Don’t be seduced by the fraternity of teamwork. This is a business, not a sport. Businesses need leaders. And leaders need to be rewarded.Read more at location 407   

The idea that raising investment is a mark of success—and a badge of honor—is the Investment Fallacy. Investment is a burden as much as—or more than—an opportunity. It increases the pressure, corrupts your incentives, and creates a communications minefield. Court it at your peril.Read more at location 415   

I already had a debt (of honor as well as money) to the first-round investors, so I was desperate to keep the company—and hence the dream—alive. But I failed to realize that with that money came the responsibility of managing those investors’ expectations.Read more at location 510   

The longer you can hold out without investment, the greater your control, the greater the ultimate rewards, and the greater your chance of success. If you must take investment, remember: the job now gets harder, not easier. Don’t party: get back to work.Read more at location 532   

Failure is not a choice: it is an outcome. That outcome may come about as a result of your mistakes; or it may come about as a result of events outside your control. Either way, making the right choices about how to handle that failure is a crucial step to ultimate business success.Read more at location 545   

The trick is not to act like failure is not an option—the trick is to know when failure is the right option.Read more at location 547   

Within a couple of months of my eureka moment, I had a product ready to launch. But what next? How do you get a product into the market? What do you charge for it? You might think I’d have thought of that earlier. I’d built a new product for a market I had assumed was out there, but the extent of my market research had consisted of me sitting alone in my office, late at night, failing to find stamps. I had a test market sample size of one.Read more at location 594   

THE TECH FALLACY When a mathematician stumbles upon an unsolved problem, she feels a nagging pressure grow in the back of her brain that relentlessly pushes her to seek a solution. When a sculptor has a vision for a block of marble, he has to excavate it until that vision is brought to life. The entrepreneur has a similar reaction when stumbling upon a new business idea. It must be acted on! This was how I felt when I had that eureka moment in my office late at night while fumbling for an envelope and stamps. This is how I built most of my early products, and it’s how most founders who pitch me for investment have created their products. This is the Tech Fallacy in operation again. It is perhaps the most pervasive of these fallacies because it draws on something instinctive in many of us: the desire to create good tech. The harsh lesson I was to learn, yet again, with Post-ASAP was that the tech isn’t enough. If the market isn’t there, the tech is pointless. This makes it crucial to start thinking about the market as soon as you conceive of a product. You may have discovered an elegant and economic solution to a problem, but is there a market for resolving that problem? There may be a niche in the market, but is there a market in the niche?Read more at location 633   

This time, I saw the writing on the wall and took preemptive action. I shut down PostASAP—but with a plan for what would follow. The idea of preparing for failure, as a founder, appears contradictory. How can you possibly succeed if you’re preparing to fail?Read more at location 651   

All startup founders need a failure plan: a plan for how to identify when your company has failed, what to do to shut it down, and how to do it. Who do you go to? How much does it cost? (Yes, closing a company costs money.) What sort of severance and notice for staff do you need to budget for?Read more at location 658   

You should write down the plan and share it with the team and investors. Once the triggers are reached, the failure plan should kick in. The company will get wound up as efficiently and as fairly as possible, there will be minimal collateral damage and—crucially—you, the founder, will be free to rebound quickly onto the next project. The crux of the failure plan for PostASAP was this: if we discover that the cost to acquire customers is greater than the amount we can make from them, let’s not do the business.Read more at location 665   

Plan for failure. Don’t expect to fail—but do expect that you might fail. Learn about the process of closing down a business: how to do it fairly and efficiently. Set negative targets: if you hit these, despite your best efforts, then you automatically trigger your failure plan and start winding down the company. Failing this way means you’re more likely to retain the loyalty of your colleagues and the respect of your clients and customers. And that makes you more likely to bounce back and succeed the next time.Read more at location 686   

But if you’re building an innovative start-up targeting non-expert users, the “experts” are the last people you want to talk to. The Expert Fallacy is the belief that the experts know best. In startup culture, the Expert Fallacy leads many a founder to rely on the analysis of established experts when, by definition, nobody can be an expert in a new product, service or market.Read more at location 713   

Invoicing, by definition, is not core business, and yet it is a crucial business function. What small businesses needed was a way to outsource their invoicing.Read more at location 746   

We developed a simple demo to send online invoices and called it BillASAP. Then we sought feedback. Logically, we went to the people most familiar with the task at hand: those accountants and bookkeepers already using complex existing software packages to do their invoicing. They asked us, where was per-line-item tax? Shipping versus billing addresses? Billing terms? Multiple customer contacts? Multiple projects per account? Line-item quantities? Invoice details with account balances? Searchable fields? Recurring invoices? Templates? Where was QuickBooks integration? And so, building on their insights, we built an online competitor to the market leader, QuickBooks, which provided accountancy software to small businesses.Read more at location 752   

Had I been following my own, hard-won, earlier insights, I would have done just the design and marketing before doing any programing.Read more at location 759   

And so we built the product, convinced that there was a market for it simply by our own enthusiasm for it. Had we tested that market, we would have realized: (a) there was already a competitor in that space, and (b) what that competitor was providing, and what the market now wanted, was not what the “experts” prescribed, but something very different – something simple and quicker. We were giving them a fully-specced MP3 player – but the market wanted the iPod Shuffle.Read more at location 762   

In retrospect, the key unknown unknown was that the Internet was going through a subtle but significant evolution. Till then, software applications were traditionally installed on the individual user’s computer. But around this time, software started migrating to the Internet.Read more at location 790   

Instead of feature-rich websites mimicking the complexity of desktop software, a new breed of websites stripped their services back to their core value, their unique selling point: the simplest way to get what you needed done. This, in turn, made them accessible to much larger markets.Read more at location 799   

Take the field of project management, for example. To create a project plan in the leading project management software, Microsoft Project, you had to answer questions on dependencies, resource allocations, critical paths, and Gantt charts. Then along came an upstart, Basecamp.com. Its premise was laughable: it was just an online checklist.Read more at location 804   

It turned out this was just what many people needed. They didn’t want other features—or the burden of learning how to use them, or the pricing. This super simple hook launched a major new business that fast became a market leader.Read more at location 807   

No expert would have advised aspiring project management software makers to develop a checklist. And our experts advised us to abandon simple invoicing and develop precisely the same intimidating complexity that was keeping our target user away from the existing software.Read more at location 810   

The new market didn’t want a complex software package. The new market had no bias toward what was already existing. It just needed a critical business task done. And the simpler the better.Read more at location 819   

We were positioning ourselves as an online competitor to the offline market leader, QuickBooks. But Blinksale’s attitude was: What’s the market? We were trying to appeal to an audience that would never have come to us. We were going after QuickBooks aficionados, but by definition, QuickBooks aficionados were conservative. Blinksale was going after the market that was repelled by QuickBooks—and the market that didn’t even know QuickBooks existed. They were redefining the market.Read more at location 823   

This was another “unknown unknown” that we faced. In retrospect, it was embarrassingly obvious. We didn’t know who our market was, and, therefore, we didn’t know what they wanted. And we didn’t know that we didn’t know this, because we were relying on insights gained through developing an earlier product, not through rigorous testing of the new market.Read more at location 827   

We had simply trusted that by providing a better service than an existing one, users would migrate to us. It hadn’t occurred to us that those users might be too loyal to their existing service to move.Read more at location 831   

And if we couldn’t find our market among existing users of invoicing software, where would we find it? Among people who had never used invoicing software.Read more at location 833   

Experts are good when you want to know how something works. But when you want to challenge the very premise of something, experts are the last people you should talk to.Read more at location 841   

Beware of the experts. Don’t ignore them altogether, but look to them for targeted expertise, not systemic analysis. Experts, by definition, have bought into the system. If you want to create systemic change, they won’t help you.Read more at location 864   

It didn’t work out like that. Instead, when I did finally have a success, it wasn’t with my own idea. In fact, I didn’t even like the idea.Read more at location 892   

The Idea Fallacy afflicts not just the tech sector, but the wider culture. The Idea Fallacy is the deep-rooted belief that what really counts is the idea, not the implementation. There’s nothing wrong with a good idea—but an idea without implementation is largely worthless. Good ideas are far less rare than we think—what’s really scarce is the ability to execute.Read more at location 893   

The Idea Fallacy is the belief that inspiration, not perspiration, is the fount of creative success, whether in the arts, the creative industries, or in startups. It is the belief that the root of success lies in the idea rather than the execution—the belief that ideas have substantial intrinsic value—that they are the key item in the startup value chain.Read more at location 962   

Ryanair, Europe’s largest airline—named after one of its founders, Tony Ryan—was a loss-making tiny Irish airline until Michael O’Leary applied the Southwest model and duly revolutionized the European airline industry.Read more at location 975   

Facebook, Google, Apple, Uber, Airbnb, Zappos—none of them were built on original ideas. Competitors were doing the same thing at the same time, sometimes even before them. But they executed better.Read more at location 977   

This is counterintuitive to many first-time founders. Let’s say you have what you think is a brilliant business idea and you want to see if it’s viable. Which of these situations would you prefer to find? There are existing businesses with the same idea that are thriving. There are existing businesses with the same idea that are struggling. There are no businesses with that idea. First-time founders always answer (c). For me, the answer is always (a).Read more at location 981   

One of the first challenges a startup faces is to prove that there is a market for its product. The existence of thriving competitors proves that there is a market. After that, it’s all about execution: if you execute better than the competitors, you will win market share.Read more at location 987   

Don’t be seduced by the brilliance of your idea—or anybody else’s. Test it on the market: if it works, develop it. If it doesn’t, move on. If there are already competitors with the same idea and they’re thriving, that proves there’s a market. Take it on. Share your ideas—don’t hoard them. An idea that you’re never going to execute could be the seed of somebody else’s success—and help make the ecosystem better for everyone.Read more at location 997   

The Scale Fallacy convinces would-be founders to focus on digital products that scale. But focusing on the services they could sell would make many of them more successful more quickly, and that might give them a platform on which to later build a scalable startup.Read more at location 1011   

This safety net was a consultancy.Read more at location 1017   

As we learned from our own failures, as well as those of others, and took on board the coding language Ruby and the agile development process, we became a team of consultant-innovators, building new products for other people to bring to market.Read more at location 1027   

Those clients were focusing on the product, as if that were the hard part of the development process. I learned from watching them fail that going to market was the hard part.Read more at location 1036   

If you’re prepared to put the dream on hold and take a cold look at your prospects, you’ll realize that there are significant advantages to creating a services business—one that doesn’t scale. You’ll see money on day one, instead of working towards a future payday—which may never come. You’ll learn about the cutting edge of what customers are demanding (and developing). And this combination of revenue to play with and a sense of what is in demand can provide the perfect ingredients with which to subsequently create a successful scalable product business.Read more at location 1084   

Don’t be seduced by the popular emphasis on scalability and success. Look at what you can do and what the people around you need. If you have skills they can use, sell them. Use those skills to get inside other corporate and creative environments so you can learn from other people’s mistakes before you have to learn from your own. When you want to build your own scalable startup, build it on the foundation of your services business. It will be stronger and more nimble, and you’ll have a cushion if it collapses.Read more at location 1091   

First-time founders, in particular, should take their exit when they can. Get out, go on a holiday, and then get back in the game. Instead of holding out for a better exit, move on and create one with a new product.Read more at location 1109   

Amazon (under Vogels) had realized that those solutions would be of value to the market. And, ultimately, that data storage could be of more value than its retail business.Read more at location 1124   

And I had learned a valuable lesson in the process: don’t hold out for your ideal exit.Read more at location 1172   

had failed to keep key people abreast of my movements and my plans. That meant that when I sought to divest my stock and break with the company, it came as a shock. Both sides reacted badly and relations broke down. That was unnecessary, and it hurt.Read more at location 1181   

But let’s say your perspective on these things hasn’t been distorted—but you still think the value being placed on your stake is too low—it is objectively too low, in other words. Take the offer, I say.Read more at location 1210   

You’re someone who has developed and delivered a startup to an exit—a rare thing.Read more at location 1223   

An exit gives you the chance (and some funds) to start again. You’ve had your first success: the second should be easier. Better to be out there creating anew than stewing over your first creation and trying to sweat the maximum return from it.Read more at location 1226   

It doesn’t matter how much work you’ve put in or how great your idea is. There is no magic sum that you are “worth.” There is only what the market will pay. That will change for reasons outside your control, and it may go down as well as up. Take the money. And don’t look back. So take your exit.Read more at location 1231   

On the contrary, quality is a distraction. Your product should be only as good as it needs to be to be brought to market. Anything more is a waste. Waste will undermine your company in the long run and lower the chance of your product finding market success.Read more at location 1244   

Focus your energies and resources where they’re most needed: build a minimum viable product (MVP); then concentrate on getting that to market and getting customers to it. Think of an MVP as a “Franken-product” – something cobbled together out of whatever’s lying around. My next startup was a case in point.Read more at location 1246   

We started using Google AdWords to send traffic to the landing page. We tested everything. We tested the price point; we tested new features; we tested various pricing plans. We did all of this before we fully developed the product.Read more at location 1302   

Many of the features we were testing in our pricing plans did not yet exist. Then, when we identified a price point and standard set of features at which we could attract a core group of customers, we started “backfilling” those features and building up the product. We called it RightSignature.Read more at location 1304   

and you will likely need to invest in Google AdWords to send traffic to those different landing pages. That will give you three key pieces of information: What attracts your customers. How much it costs (in advertising spend) to find them. How much they are willing to pay. That will give you an immediate model for the viability of your business.Read more at location 1327   

When PostASAP failed (see Fallacy Four), Michael Crandell introduced me to the concept of market validation.Read more at location 1372   

You should be proud of your product and business in the long term. Making it a success may mean being willing to work with a Franken-product in the short term.Read more at location 1406   

TAKEAWAY: HOW TO AVOID THE QUALITY FALLACY Your product doesn’t need to be finished to bring it to market—it just needs to work. Build a Franken-product—a minimum viable product—as quickly and cheaply as you can and release that to the market. Use the market’s feedback to refine your product so that you know you’re working on something the market wants, not something you think the market needs.Read more at location 1409   

The Passion Fallacy is the belief that passion should drive your startup—that the magic ingredient is your belief in your product.Read more at location 1478   

On the contrary, passion clouds judgment. I want to see evidence of cold, hard business acumen before I invest in a startup; that can exist alongside passion, sure, but more often founders seem to think that passion is an acceptable substitute.Read more at location 1479   

The model I am trying to explain to him is a performance model rather than a partner model. The essence of the performance model is that you can “force-feed” your market in order to test the performance of your product in the market from the earliest stages of its development.Read more at location 1529   

Instead of waiting for your market to miraculously discover you, or for your partners or even the media to push you out to the market, you can proactively push your product into the market.Read more at location 1532   

We’ve seen some of the elements of this already: you use Google AdWords to direct traffic to landing pages and use those to test interest in your product and get key metrics, such as price points. Then you launch a minimum viable product in order to test the market and use customer feedback to improve and reshape the product.Read more at location 1535   

The channel should be one where you can amplify the results, depending on how much you spend. So if you get positive initial results at a very low spend, you can then tentatively increase the spend and see if that positive response holds true. It’s like a volume knob: you start it low and then, if your early results are positive, you crank it up and see if the positive feedback holds. If the results are negative, you try a different channel or strategy.Read more at location 1542   

The tenth? She’s the one that intends to prove her product through a performance model—one that allows her to refine her product in response to the market and test the market’s appetite before she commits all her resources. I’ll invest in her. Every time.”Read more at location 1556   

I’m not interested in ideas. And I’m not interested in passion. In fact, passion worries me. Too often, it hides other weaknesses. I’m interested in execution. And “execution” doesn’t mean “tech.” As we’ve seen, the pursuit of good tech leads to the Tech Fallacy—the focus on tech for tech’s sake. All I want from the tech is a clunky prototype—a Franken-product, or MVP—that allows for some market testing. “Execution” means the ability to bring a product to market.Read more at location 1568   

The market for Facebook is everybody who has friends. The market for Airbnb is everybody who travels. And so the market for these new services tends to be everybody who has garbage, or pets, or babies. But the question is: how do you reach that market? How does that market learn of your existence? (There is a paradox here: a large market may not be a good thing. The larger the market, the harder it is to be seen by it.) How many people in that market will be willing to pay for your service? And what will they be willing to pay? These are evidential questions. The answers require research—maybe very simple research. And almost no founder I meet ever has the answers.Read more at location 1575   

There are four things you need to know when building a new product: Do people want it? How much will it cost to find them? How much are they willing to pay for it? How many of them are there? These are the four standard questions I ask every founder I meet.Read more at location 1596   

Market testing is no guarantee of success. But it certainly helps you go in that direction.Read more at location 1637   

Founders too often fall down a tech cul-de-sac—or rabbit hole—where they focus on their tech problem to the exclusion of all else. Worry about the market first – finessing the tech can come later (if at all). Developing technology is expensive. Finding out if there’s a market for that tech can be much cheaper.Read more at location 1647   

Shared leadership slows down decision making. Shared equity blunts incentives. Democracy works for countries, for communities, and even for some long-established cooperative businesses. It doesn’t work for startups.Read more at location 1652   

You just have to read the tech press to see how pervasive this is: stories trumpeting some firm’s success in raising Series A or B funding are a staple. Rarely stressed is the potential downside: greater pressure on the business, a diluted stake for the founders and often legal obstacles to cashing that stake in, and, most ominously, misaligned investor and founder incentives.Read more at location 1656   

Avoid taking investment as far as possible.Read more at location 1659   

This runs right through American public life. Perhaps it has a place in sport (though I doubt it is ever healthy). But in business, it is positively damaging. We all prefer to succeed than fail, but failure is an almost inevitable step on the path to success. How you fail may determine your likelihood of succeeding in the future.Read more at location 1663   

The belief that the experts know best. Obviously, there is a place for this: in rocket science, in medicine, in Nascar racing. But be wary of the experts in startups and in technology in particular. By definition, a disruptive technology can have no preexisting experts.Read more at location 1671   

Experts become experts because of their dedication to a field of study, which is a good thing in itself. But it’s precisely that dedication that makes them singularly unqualified to anticipate challenges to the basis of that field of study: systemic change.Read more at location 1674   

The idea that inspiration counts more than perspiration. It may be surprising that this fallacy is so pervasive, given that its damaging consequences are so ingrained in Silicon Valley’s self-awareness. The Idea Fallacy was at the root of the dot-com bust of 2001: too much capital behind too many ideas with not enough market.Read more at location 1677   

Fallacy Seven: The Scale Fallacy The belief that the only thing that counts in the tech startup world is a product that can scale. This is probably symptomatic of the influence of venture capital, which has long demonstrated a preference for companies that can scale over companies where growth is, at best, steady - product companies rather than services companies. I discovered services as a teenager. Consulting helped me pay my way through college, experiment with early startups, skill up through working with clients on cutting-edge products, and consistently gave me a bedrock of support and a safety net of income as I failed and failed again with my own product startups.Read more at location 1683   

Your business is worth what someone will pay for it. Your equity is worth what someone will pay for it, if you can release it. Pay no attention to what you’re worth “on paper,” and don’t be driven by the expectations of others (or your younger self) as to what success is. If you get a timely offer that will help you take on other challenges, take it.Read more at location 1695   

This is another fallacy with deep cultural roots. In the wider culture, of course, there is much to be said for the pursuit of quality for its own sake. But in the tech startup sector, such focus on absolute quality can be distracting, at best, and destructive, at worst. Startups should set their expectations on a minimum viable product—an MVP. Only if and when that gets traction in the market sufficient to fund its development is there room to focus on quality.Read more at location 1700   

This, like the Tech Fallacy, is endemic. The point is not that you should not be passionate about your product; rather, you do not need to be passionate about it, and your passion is not necessarily a selling point.
