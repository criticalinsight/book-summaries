“You didn’t invent that idea.” We’re not claiming to have invented these techniques. Many of these concepts have been around in one form or another for a long time. Don’t get huffy if you read some of our advice and it reminds you of something you read about already on so and so’s weblog or in some book published 20 years ago. It’s definitely possible. These techniques are not at all exclusive to 37signals. We’re just telling you how we work and what’s been successful for us.


We think it’s better to present ideas in bold strokes than to be wishy-washy about it. If that comes off as cocky or arrogant, so be it.


The sooner you find out about fundamental issues that are wrong with an idea, the better.


Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to everyone else.


A great way to build software is to start out by solving your own problems.


When you solve your own problem, you create a tool that you’re passionate about. And passion is key. Passion means you’ll truly use it and care about it. And that’s the best way to get others to feel passionate about it too.


We decided to clear our schedule and have a go at building our dream email marketing tool. We consciously decided not to look at what everyone else was doing and instead build something that would make ours and our customer’s lives a little easier.


When you write a book, you need to have more than an interesting story. You need to have a desire to tell the story. You need to be personally invested in some way. If you’re going to live with something for two years, three years, the rest of your life, you need to care about it.


Run on limited resources and you’ll be forced to reckon with constraints earlier and more intensely. And that’s a good thing. Constraints drive innovation.


If your idea’s a lemon, it’s time to go back to the drawing board.


Here’s an easy way to launch on time and on budget: keep them fixed. Never throw more time or money at a problem, just scale back the scope.


Our recommendation: Scope down. It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product


We created an app that let people share and collaborate on ideas simply, without bogging them down with non-essential features.


One bonus you get from having an enemy is a very clear marketing message. People are stoked by conflict. And they also understand a product by comparing it to others. With a chosen enemy, you’re feeding people a story they want to hear. Not only will they understand your product better and faster, they’ll take sides. And that’s a sure-fire way to get attention and ignite passion.


Don’t follow the leader


Instead, you must tell a different story and persuade listeners that your story is more important than the story they currently believe.


One of the quickest ways to get yourself into trouble is to look at what your competitors are doing.


Keep it small and managable so you can actually enjoy the process.


If your app doesn’t excite you, something’s wrong.


When it comes to web technology, change must be easy and cheap.


Nimble, agile, less-mass businesses can quickly change their entire business model, product, feature set, and marketing message. They can make mistakes and fix them quickly.


They can change their priorities, product mix, and focus. And, most importantly, they can change their minds.


Cheap and fast changes are small’s secret weapon.


Keep it small. Keep it simple. Let it happen.


For the first version of your app, start with only three people. That’s the magic number that will give you enough manpower yet allow you to stay streamlined and agile. Start with a developer, a designer, and a sweeper (someone who can roam between both worlds).


Talented people don’t need endless resources. They thrive on the challenge of working within restraints and using their creativity to solve problems.


Remember, it’s OK to keep your first version small and tight. You’ll quickly get to see if your idea has wings and, if it does, you’ll have a clean, simple base to build on.


Keep the team as small as possible.


Communication flows more easily on small teams than large teams. If you’re the only person on a project, communication is simple.


Instead of freaking out about these constraints, embrace them. Let them guide you. Constraints drive innovation and force focus. Instead of trying to remove them, use them to your advantage.


Constraints are often advantages in disguise. Forget about venture capital, long release cycles, and quick hires. Instead, work with what you have.


A lot of small companies make the mistake of trying to act big. It’s


If you’re small, you can use familiar language instead of jargon. Your site and your product can have a human voice instead of sounding like a corporate drone.


No matter what business you are in, good customer service has got to be the biggest request that any client will ever make.


Before you start designing or coding anything you need to know the purpose of your product – the vision. Think big. Why does it exist? What makes it different than other similar products?


Your vision should be brief too. A sentence should be enough to get the idea across.


Basecamp: Project management is communication


Make the big decision about your vision upfront and all your future little decisions become much easier.


Work from large to small


the details. You’ll also find stagnation, disagreement, meetings, and delays. These things can kill morale and lower your chances of success.


How often have you realized that the progress you made today wasn’t real progress? This happens when you focus on details too early in the process. There’s plenty of time to be a perfectionist. Just do it later.


Don’t worry about the size of your headline font in week one. You don’t need to nail that perfect shade of green in week two. You don’t need to move that “submit” button three pixels to the right in week three. Just get the stuff on the page for now. Then use it. Make sure it works. Later on you can adjust and perfect it.


I really got over the “get into details right away” attitude after I took some drawing classes...If you begin to draw the details right away you can be sure that the drawing is going to suck. In fact, you are completely missing the point.


Work from large to small. Always.


Don’t sweat stuff until you actually must. Don’t overbuild. Increase hardware and system software as necessary.


Bottom Line: Make decisions just in time, when you have access to the real information you need.


If you try to please everyone, you won’t please anyone


When we built Basecamp we focused our marketing on design firms.


Focusing on a core market also makes it much easier to spread the word about your software. Now that we have a tightly defined audience, we can advertise where they frequent online, publish articles they might find interesting, and generally build a community around our product.


Create a great app and then worry about what to do once it’s wildly successful.


Otherwise you may waste energy, time, and money fixating on something that never even happens.


And remember, if they don’t like your vision there are plenty of other visions out there for people. Don’t go chasing people you’ll never make happy.


Our apps have followed a similar path. They don’t try to be all things to all people.


Take whatever you think your product should be and cut it in half. Pare features down until you’re left with only the most essential ones.


With Basecamp, we started with just the messages section. We knew that was the heart of the app so we ignored milestones, to-do lists,


Start off with a lean, smart app and let it gain traction. Then you can add to the solid foundation you’ve built.


“Because it just doesn’t matter.” That statement embodies what makes a product great. Figuring out what matters and leaving out the rest.


“Why don’t you allow bold or italic or colored formatting in the chats?” Answer: It just doesn’t matter. If you need to emphasize something use the trusty CAPS LOCK key or toss a few *’s around the word or phrase.


If it doesn’t change your behavior, then it just doesn’t matter.


The best designers and the best programmers aren’t the ones with the best skills, or the nimblest fingers, or the ones who can rock and roll with Photoshop or their environment of choice, they are the ones that can determine what just doesn’t matter. That’s where the real gains are made.


Most of the time you spend is wasted on things that just don’t matter. If you can cut out the work and thinking that just don’t matter, you’ll achieve productivity you’ve never imagined.


The secret to building half a product instead of a half-ass product is saying no.


Every new feature request that comes to us – or from us – meets a no. We listen but don’t act. The initial response is “not now.” If a request for a feature keeps coming back, that’s when we know it’s time to take a deeper look. Then, and only then, do we start considering the feature for real.


My favorite line of the day was when people kept raising their hand saying, “Does it do [x]?”, “Do you plan to add [y]?”. Finally Jobs said, “Wait wait – put your hands down. Listen: I know you have a thousand ideas for all the cool features iTunes could have. So do we. But we don’t want a thousand features. That would be ugly. Innovation is not about saying yes to everything. It’s about saying NO to all but the most crucial features.”


Build products and offer services you can manage. It’s easy to make promises. It’s much harder to keep them.


Do the best job you can with the root of the problem then step aside. People will find their own solutions and conventions within your general framework.


But, as we mentioned before, your first response should be a no. So what do you do with all these requests that pour in? Where do you store them? How do you manage them? You don’t. Just read them and then throw them away.


You can’t forget what’s important when you are reminded of it every day.


Sometimes it’s better to just say no and maintain your vision for the product.


Why not ask people what they don’t want? “If you could remove one feature, what would it be?” “What don’t you use?” “What gets in your way the most?”


Innovation Comes From Saying No


[Innovation] comes from saying no to 1,000 things to make sure we don’t get on the wrong track or try to do too much. We’re always thinking about new markets we could enter, but it’s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.


I do not think I’ve ever been involved with a software project – large or small – that was successful in terms of schedule, cost, or functionality that started with a long period of planning and discussion and no concurrent development. It is simply too easy, and sometimes fun, to waste valuable time inventing features that turn out to be unnecessary or unimplementable.


Don’t expect to get it right the first time. Let the app grow and speak to you. Let it morph and evolve. With web-based software there’s no need to ship perfection. Design screens, use them, analyze them, and then start over again.


You don’t need to aim for perfection on the first try if you know it’s just going to be done again later anyway. Knowing that you’re going to revisit issues is a great motivator to just get ideas out there to see if they’ll fly.


Unfortunately, we’re terrible at planning ahead, at understanding the ramifications of our actions and in prioritizing the stuff that really matters.


Customers shouldn’t have to think about every nitty gritty detail – don’t put that burden on them when it should be your responsibility.


Decisions are temporary so make the call and move on


Done. Start to think of it as a magical word. When you get to done it means something’s been accomplished. A decision has been made and you can move on. Done means you’re building momentum.


But wait, what if you screw up and make the wrong call? It’s OK. This isn’t brain surgery, it’s a web app.


To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed. They are just a multiplier. Execution is worth millions.


Break it down Estimates that stretch into weeks or months are fantasies. The truth is you just don’t know what’s going to happen that far in advance.


Are you facing an issue that’s too big to wrap your mind around? Break it down. Keep dividing problems into smaller and smaller pieces until you’re able to digest them.


The alone time zone is where the real development magic happens.


Set up a rule at work: Make half the day alone time. From 10am-2pm, no one can talk to one another (except during lunch). Or make the first or the last half of the day the alone time period. Just make sure this period is contiguous in order to avoid productivity-killing interruptions.


A successful alone time period means letting go of communication addiction. During alone time, give up instant messenging, phone calls, and meetings. Avoid any email thread that’s going to require an immediate response. Just shut up and get to work.


Don’t have meetings Do you really need a meeting? Meetings usually arise when a concept isn’t clear enough. Instead of resorting to a meeting, try to simplify the concept so you can discuss it quickly via email or IM or Campfire. The goal is to avoid meetings. Every minute you avoid spending in a meeting is a minute you can get real work done instead.


Pretty soon memos and meetings eat up the entire work day.


The solution is clear: break teams into smaller, autonomous and independent units to reduce these communications links.


Long, drawn out release cycles are motivation killers. They insert too much time between celebrations. On the other hand, quick wins that you can celebrate are great motivators. If you let lengthy release cycles quash quick wins, you kill the motivation. And that can kill your product.


So don’t hire. Really. Don’t hire people. Look for another way. Is the work that’s burdening you really necessary? What if you just don’t do it? Can you solve the problem with a slice of software or a change of practice instead?


Whenever Jack Welch, former CEO of GE, used to fire someone, he didn’t immediately hire a replacement. He wanted to see how long GE could get along without that person and that position.


Brooks’ law Adding people to a late software project makes it later.


The real trouble with using a lot of mediocre programmers instead of a couple of good ones is that no matter how long they work, they never produce something as good as what the great programmers can produce.


Before we hire anyone we give them a small project to chew on first. We see how they handle the project, how they communicate, how they work, etc. Working with someone as they design or code a few screens will give you a ton of insight. You’ll learn pretty quickly whether or not the right vibe is there.


Try a small test assignment to start. Don’t leap in with all of your work at once. Give your new [virtual assistant] a test project or two to work on and see how the chemistry develops. In the beginning, it’s too easy to gloss over potential problems with rose-colored glasses. Make it clear this is a test run.


If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know.


Small teams need people who can wear different hats. You need designers who can write. You need programmers who understand design. Everyone should have an idea about how to architect information (whatever that may mean). Everyone needs to have an organized mind. Everyone needs to be able to communicate with customers.


A happy yet average employee is better than a disgruntled expert.


Find someone who’s enthusiastic. Someone you can trust to get things done when left alone. Someone who’s suffered at a bigger, slower company and longs for a new environment. Someone who’s excited to build what you’re building. Someone who hates the same things you hate. Someone who’s thrilled to climb aboard your train.


Design is relatively light. A paper sketch is cheap and easy to change. HTML designs are still relatively simple to modify (or throw out). That’s not true of programming. Designing first keeps you flexible. Programming first fences you in and sets you up for additional costs.


Over the next two weeks I refined the designs, and completely mocked-up static HTML pages for almost the entire first version of what would become Blinksale. We never did any wireframes beyond those orange-pen sketches, and getting straight into the HTML design helped us stay excited about how “real” the project was becoming, even though at the time we really didn’t know what we were getting into.


Epicenter design focuses on the true essence of the page – the epicenter – and then builds outward. This means that, at the start, you ignore the extremities: the navigation/tabs, footer, colors, sidebar, logo, etc. Instead, you start at the epicenter and design the most important piece of content first.


Design for regular, blank, and error states


Ignoring the blank slate stage is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. The blank slate is your app’s first impression and you never get a second...well, you know.


Unfortunately, the customer decides if an application is worthy at this blank slate stage


Use it as an opportunity to insert quick tutorials and help blurbs.


Give a sample screenshot of the page populated with data so people know what to expect


Explain how to get started, what the screen will eventually look like, etc.


First impressions are crucial. If you fail to design a thoughtful blank slate, you’ll create a negative (and false) impression of your application or service.


You Never Get A Second Chance... Another aspect of the Mac OS X UI that I think has been tremendously influenced by [Steve] Jobs is the setup and first-run experience.


That’s why context is more important than consistency. It’s OK to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way. Give people just what matters. Give them what they need when they need it and get rid of what they don’t.


It’s better to be right than to be consistent.


What matters on the Web is whether, on each individual page, the user can quickly and easily advance the next step in the process.


Copywriting is interface design. Great interfaces are written. If you think every pixel, every icon, every typeface matters, then you also need to believe every letter matters.


You need to speak the same language as your audience too. Just because you’re writing a web app doesn’t mean you can get away with technical jargon. Think about your customers and think about what those buttons and words mean to them. Don’t use acronyms or words that most people don’t understand. Don’t use internal lingo. Don’t sound like an engineer talking to another engineer. Keep it short and sweet. Say what you need to and no more.


To avoid crappy-admin-screen syndrome, don’t build separate screens to deal with admin functions. Instead, build these functions (i.e. edit, add, delete) into the regular application interface.


If you have to maintain two separate interfaces (i.e. one for regular folks and one for admins), both will suffer. In effect, you wind up paying the same tax twice.


each time you increase the amount of code, your software grows exponentially more complicated.


The way you fight this complexity is with less software. Less software means less features, less code, less waste.


software means you put away the crystal ball. Instead of trying to predict future problems, you deal only with the problems of today. Why? Fears you have about tomorrow often never come to fruition. Don’t bog yourself down trying to solve these phantom issues.


of trying to build products that do more, we build products that do less.


software lowers your cost of change so you can adapt quickly. You


be afraid to say no to feature requests that are hard to do. Unless they’re absolutely essential, save time/effort/confusion by leaving them out.


down too. Don’t take action on an idea for a week and see if it still seems like a great idea after


every feature that makes it into your app, ask yourself: Is there a way this can be added that won’t require as much software? Write just


is No CODE That is More Flexible Than NO Code!


Listen when your code pushes back


Is a new feature requiring weeks of time and thousands of lines of code? That’s your code telling you there’s probably a better way. Is there a simple way to code something in one hour instead of a complicated way that will take ten hours? Again, that’s your code guiding you. Listen.


Don’t worry about design, if you listen to your code a good design will appear...Listen to the technical people. If they are complaining about the difficulty of making changes, then take such complaints seriously and give them time to fix things.


If programmers got paid to remove code from sofware instead of writing new code, software would be a whole lot better.


Offer APIs that let third-party developers build on to your tool. When you do, you make life more convenient for customers and expand the possibilities of what your app can do.


Don’t write a functional specifications document These blueprint docs usually wind up having almost nothing to do with the finished product.


Functional specs force you to make the most important decisions when you have the least information


You know the least about something when you begin to build it. The more you build it, the more you use it, the more you know it. That’s when you should be making decisions – when you have more information, not less.


A feature is signed off and agreed on. Even if you realize during development that it’s a bad idea, you’re stuck with it. Specs don’t deal with the reality that once you start building something, everything changes.


Write a one page story about what the app needs to do. Use plain language and make it quick. If it takes more than a page to explain it, then it’s too complex. This process shouldn’t take more than one day.


Then begin building the interface – the interface will be the alternative to the functional spec. Draw some quick and simple paper sketches. Then start coding it into HTML. Unlike paragraphs of text that are open to alternate interpretations, interface designs are common ground that everyone can agree on.


Confusion disappears when everyone starts using the same screens. Build an interface everyone can start looking at, using, clicking through, and “feeling” before you start worrying about back-end code. Get yourself in front of the customer experience as much as possible.


I found the people insisting on extensive requirements documents before starting any design were really ‘blockers’ just trying to slow the process down (and usually people with nothing to contribute on design or innovative thinking).


All our best work was done with a few concepts in our heads about improving a site, doing a quick prototype (static), changing the design a bit and then building a live prototype with real data. After kicking the tires on this prototype, we usually had a real project in motion and good result.


Eliminate unnecessary paperwork Avoiding functional specs is a good start but don’t stop there; Prevent excess paperwork everywhere. Unless a document is actually going to morph into something real, don’t produce it.


Build, don’t write. If you need to explain something, try mocking it up and prototyping it rather than writing a long-winded document. An actual interface or prototype is on its way to becoming a real product. A piece of paper, on the other hand, is only on its way to the garbage can.


Documents that live separately from your application are worthless. They don’t get you anywhere. Everything you do should evolve into the real thing. If a document stops before it turns real, it’s dead.


Don’t waste your time typing up that long visionary tome; no one’s going to read it. Take consolation in the fact that if you give your product enough room to grow itself, in the end it won’t resemble anything you wrote about anyway.


Write stories, not details


If you do find yourself requiring words to explain a new feature or concept, write a brief story about it. Don’t get into the technical or design details, just tell a quick story. Do it in a human way, like you would in normal conversation.


Insert actual text instead of lorem ipsum


You need real copy to see how tables will expand or contract. You need real copy to know what your app truly looks like.


It’s a noisy world out there. In order to get people to notice you amid the din, give something away for free.


Consider giving one of your songs (per-album) as a free promotional download to the world – to be like the movie trailer – like the hit single sent to radio – the song that makes people want to go buy your music.


Make it as easy as possible to get in – and get out – of your app.


If I’m a customer that wants to use your app, it should be a painless, no-brainer process. Provide a big, clear, signup button that pops and put it on each page of your marketing site. Tell folks how easy it is: “From sign-up to login in just 1 minute!”


Keep the signup form as short as possible. Don’t ask for stuff you don’t need and don’t throw a long daunting form at people.


“Cancel my account” is a link that’s clear as day on a person’s account page. There shouldn’t be any email to send, special form to fill out, or questions to answer.


Avoid long-term contracts, sign-up fees, etc.


No one likes long term contracts, early termination fees, or one-time set-up fees. So avoid them.


Our products bill on a month-to-month basis. There’s no contract to sign and you can cancel at any time without penalty. And there are never any set-up fees.


To build up buzz and anticipation, go with a Hollywood-style launch: 1) Teaser, 2) Preview, and 3) Launch.


By the time we launch our apps, we have thousands of emails to ping which is a big help in gaining traction.


Post about your progress: How many people have signed up? What updates/tweaks have you made?


Finally, about two weeks before we launched, we invited a handful of friends, colleagues, and industry mavens to help us beta test Blinksale.


(and it’s a hell of a lot cheaper)


Start off by creating a blog that not only touts your product but offers helpful advice, tips, tricks, links, etc. Our Signal vs. Noise blog gets thousands of unique readers a week thanks to the helpful, informative, and interesting bits and anecdotes we post on a daily basis.


We’ve already touched on it but it bears repeating: Get some sort of site up and start collecting emails as soon as possible. Pick your domain name and put up a logo and maybe a sentence or two that describes, or at least hints at, what your app will do. Then let people give you their email address. Now you’re on your way to having a foundation of folks ready and waiting to be notified of your launch.


Share your knowledge with the world


And when the subject you’re teaching is your app, it serves a dual purpose: You can give something back to the community that supports you and score some nice promotional exposure at the same time.


As a promotional technique, education is a soft way to get your name – and your product’s name – in front of more people.


People who you educate will become your evangelists.


Teaching is all about good karma. You’re paying it forward. You’re helping others. You get some healthy promotion. And you can even bask in a bit of nobility. So what do you know that the world wants to hear about?


The more that a company shares its knowledge, the more valuable it becomes. Companies that share their intellectual property and business processes with customers and partners are more likely to have their knowledge (or products) passed along to prospective customers. People tend to evangelize products and services they love, admire or find valuable.


Those who teach stand the best chance of getting people to become passionate. And those with the most passionate users don’t need an ad campaign when they’ve got user evangelists doing what evangelists do... talking about their passion.


Existing customers are your best bet for sales. Don’t be shy about trying to get repeat business from people who already know and use your product.


Give your app a name that’s easy to remember


A big mistake a lot of people make is thinking their app’s name needs to be ultradescriptive. Don’t worry about picking a name that vividly describes your tool’s purpose;


Pick a name that’s short, catchy, and memorable and then run with it.


Tear down the walls between support and development


The solution? Avoid building walls between your customers and the development/design team. Don’t outsource customer support to a call center or third party. Do it yourself. You, and your whole team, should know what your customers are saying. When your customers are annoyed, you need to know about it. You need to hear their complaints. You need to get annoyed too.


The front lines are where the action is. Get up there. Have your chefs work as waiters. Read customer emails, hear their frustrations, listen to their suggestions and learn from them.


Use inline help and FAQs so your product doesn’t require a manual or training


You don’t need a manual to use Yahoo or Google or Amazon. So why can’t you build a product that doesn’t require a manual? Strive to build a tool that requires zero training.


How do you do this? Well, as we’ve mentioned before, you start by keeping everything simple. The less complex your app is, the less you’ll need to help people out of the weeds.


Quick turnaround time on support queries should be a top priority


you can really differentiate yourself from competitors by offering a thoughtful response right away.


Even if you don’t have a perfect answer, say something.


The way to compete with the big guys is by starting small and paying attention to every one of your customers.


This does not mean that your product has to be perfect when you launch. Quite to the contrary, release early and often.


Customers don’t expect your product to be perfect and they don’t expect that all of their features will be implemented. However, customers do expect that you are listening and acknowledging that you care, so show that you care.


Be willing to say no to your customers


Get bad news out there and out of the way If something goes wrong, tell people. Even if they never saw it in the first place.


side note about delivering news, bad and good: When bad news comes, get it all out in the open at once. Good news, on the other hand, should be trickled out slowly. If you can prolong the good vibes, do it.


Issue a major update 30 days after launch A quick update shows momentum. It shows you’re listening. It shows you’ve got more tricks up your sleeve. It gives you a second wave of buzz.


Show your product is alive by keeping an ongoing product development blog post-launch


Don’t stop blogging once you launch. Show your product is a living creature by keeping a dedicated blog that you update frequently (at least once a week, more often if you can).


A frequently-updated product blog is the best indicator that a webapp is in active development, that it’s loved and that there’s a light on at home. An abandoned product blog is a sign of an abandoned product, and says the people in charge are asleep at the wheel.


Openly link and discuss competitors. Hint at upcoming features and keep comments open for feedback.


Don’t use “beta” as a scapegoat These days it feels like everything is in beta stage forever. That’s a cop out. An interminable beta stage tells customers you’re not really committed to rolling out a finished product. It says, “Use this, but if it’s not perfect, it’s not our fault.”


Don’t wait for your product to reach perfection. It’s not gonna happen. Take responsibility for what you’re releasing.


Prioritize your bugs (and even ignore some of them) Just because you discover a bug in your product, doesn’t mean it’s time to panic. All software has bugs – it’s just a fact of life.


Bugs that result in “it doesn’t look right” errors or other misdemeanor miscues can safely be set aside for a while. If a bug destroys your database, though, you obviously need to fix it immediately.


Honesty is the best policy.


Resist the urge to panic or rapidly change things in response. Passions flare in the beginning. But if you ride out this initial 24-48 hour period, things will usually settle down. Most people respond before they’ve really dug in and used whatever you’ve added (or gotten along with what you’ve removed). So


Also, remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and more passionate than positive ones.


In fact, you may only hear negative voices even when the majority of your base is happy about a change. Make sure you don’t foolishly backpedal on a necessary, but controversial, decision.


You don’t have to become an outer space pen that writes upside down. Sometimes it’s OK to just be a pencil. You don’t need to be a swiss-army knife. You can just be a screwdriver. You don’t need to build a diving watch that’s safe at 5,000 meters if your customers are land-lovers who just want to know what the time is.


Part of the beauty of a web app is its fluidity. You don’t wrap it up in a box, ship it, and then wait years for the next release. You can tweak and change as you go along. Be open to the fact that your original idea may not be your best one.


The difference between you and everyone else will be how well you execute. Success is all about great execution.
