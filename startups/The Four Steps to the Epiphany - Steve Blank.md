Every company bringing a new product to market uses some form of Product Development Model (Figure 1.1). Emerging early in the 20th century, this product-centric model described a process that evolved in manufacturing industries. It was adopted by the consumer packaged goods industry in the 1950s and spread to the technology business in the last quarter of the 20th century. It has become an integral part of startup culture

Yellow highlight | Location: 137
To see what’s wrong with using the Product Development model as a guide to building a startup, let’s first look at how the model is currently used to launch a new product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 162
Meanwhile, Marketing refines the size of the market defined in the business plan (a market is a set of companies with common attributes), and begins to target the first customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 205
In fact, there are 10 major flaws to using the Product Development model in a startup.

Yellow highlight | Location: 206
1. Where Are the Customers? To begin with, the Product Development model ignores the fundamental truth about startups and all new products.

Yellow highlight | Location: 211
2. The Focus on First Customer Ship Date Using the Product Development model forces sales and marketing to focus on the first customer ship date.

Yellow highlight | Location: 222
The Product Development model is so focused on building and shipping the product that makes the fundamental and fatal error of ignoring the process I call Customer Discovery.

Yellow highlight | Location: 227
(A mainstream market is where the majority of people in any market segment reside. They tend to be risk-averse, pragmatic purchasers.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 237
3. An Emphasis on Execution Instead of Learning and Discovery In startups the emphasis is on “get it done, and get it done fast.” So it’s natural that heads of Sales and Marketing believe they are hired for what they know, not what they can learn.

Yellow highlight | Location: 242
This is usually a faulty assumption. Before we can build and sell a product, we have to answer some very basic questions: What are the problems our product solves? Do customers perceive these problems as important or “must-have”? If we’re selling to businesses, who in a company has a problem our product could solve? If we are selling to consumers how do we reach them? How big is this problem? Who do we make the first sales call on? Who else has to approve the purchase? How many customers do we need to be profitable? What’s the average order size?

Yellow highlight | Location: 249
A company needs to answer these questions before it can successfully ramp up sales. For startups in a new market, these are not merely execution activities; they are learning and discovery activities critical to the company’s success or failure.

Yellow highlight | Location: 263
4. The Lack of Meaningful Sales, Marketing and Business Development Milestones The one great thing you can say about Product Development using a Waterfall methodology is that it provides an unambiguous structure with clearly defined milestones.

Yellow highlight | Location: 271
Others focus on acquiring early “lighthouse” customers (prominent customers who will attract others).

Yellow highlight | Location: 273
In reality none of these is the true objective. Simply put, a startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, their pains, and the jobs they need done discovering a repeatable roadmap of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability.

Yellow highlight | Location: 276
The appropriate milestones measuring a startup’s progress answer these questions: How well do we understand what problems customers have? How much will they pay to solve those problems? Do our product features solve these problems? Do we understand our customers’ business? Do we understand the hierarchy of customer needs? Have we found visionary customers, ones who will buy our product early? Is our product a must-have for these customers? Do we understand the sales roadmap well enough to consistently sell the product? Do we understand what we need to be profitable? Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable? What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong?

Yellow highlight | Location: 281
Webvan had no milestones saying “stop and evaluate the results” (2,000 orders per day versus 8,000 forecasted) of its product launch. Before any meaningful customer feedback was in hand, and only a month after the product started shipping, Webvan signed a $1 billion deal (yes, $1,000,000,000) with Bechtel. The company committed to the construction of up to 26 additional distribution centers over the next three years.

Yellow highlight | Location: 288
5. The Use of a Product Development Methodology to Measure Sales Using the Product Development Waterfall diagram for Customer Development activities is like using a clock to tell the temperature. They both measure something, but not the thing you wanted. Figure 1.2 shows what the Product Development model looks like from a sales perspective. A VP of Sales looks at the diagram and says, “Hmm, if beta test is on this date, I’d better get a small sales team in place before that date to acquire my first ‘early customers.’

Yellow highlight | Location: 304
“Build it and they will come,” is not a strategy; it’s a prayer.

Yellow highlight | Location: 321
In fact, all the marketing plans are made in a virtual vacuum of real customer feedback and information. Of course, smart marketers have some early interaction with customers before the product ships, but if they do, it’s on their own initiative, not as part of a well-defined process. Most first-time marketers spend a large part of their time behind their desks. This is somewhat amazing, since in a startup no facts exist inside the building, only opinions.

Yellow highlight | Location: 333
Premature Scaling Having Sales and Marketing believe that by first customer ship, come hell or high water, they need fully staffed organizations leads to another disaster: premature scaling.

Yellow highlight | Location: 336
As mentioned earlier there are no milestones saying, “Stop or slow down hiring until you understand customers.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 338
In Webvan’s case premature scaling was an integral part of the company culture and the prevailing venture capital “get big fast” mantra. Webvan spent $18 million to develop proprietary software and $40 million to set up its first automated warehouse before it had shipped a single item.

Yellow highlight | Location: 342
As customer behavior continued to differ from the predictions in Webvan’s business plan, the company slowly realized it had overbuilt and over-designed. The business model made sense only at the high volumes predicted on the spreadsheet.

Yellow highlight | Location: 346
8. Death Spiral: The Cost of Getting Product Launch Wrong Premature scaling is the immediate cause of the Death Spiral. Premature scaling causes the burn rate to accelerate. Sales, salaries, facilities, infrastructure costs, recruiting fees, and travel expenses start cutting into the company’s cash flow.

Yellow highlight | Location: 355
Meanwhile, the salespeople start inventing and testing their own alternatives— different departments to call on, different versions of the presentations. Instead of following a methodology of learning and discovering, the sales team has turned into a disorganized and disgruntled mob burning lots of cash.

Yellow highlight | Location: 367
the VP of Sales in a startup who does not make the numbers is called an ex-VP of Sales

Yellow highlight | Location: 372
The new VP of Sales reviews the original strategy and tactics and comes up with a new sales plan. She gets a few months’ honeymoon from the CEO and the board.

Yellow highlight | Location: 385
In Webvan’s case, the Death Spiral was public and messy, since none of this was occurring in the intimate enclosure of a private company. The consequence of going public was the sea of red ink was printed quarterly for all to see. Rather than realize the model was unrealistic and scale back, the company continued to invest heavily in marketing and promotion (to get more customers and keep the ones they had) and distribution facilities (building new ones in new parts of the country to reach more customers). By the end of 2000 Webvan had accumulated a deficit of $612.7 million and was hemorrhaging cash. Seven months later, it was bankrupt.

Yellow highlight | Location: 391
One of the radical insights guiding this book is that startups fall into one of four basic categories: Bringing a new product into an existing market Bringing a new product into a new market Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a low-cost entrant Bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to resegment that market as a niche entrant

Yellow highlight | Location: 395
traditional Product Development model at times succeeds in getting a product out the door into a known market with known customers (first category).

Yellow highlight | Location: 397
However, since most startups are not going after known markets (falling into the second and third categories), they don’t have a clue where their customers are.

Yellow highlight | Location: 399
Webvan fell into the fourth category—bringing a new product (online grocery ordering and same-day delivery) into an existing market (the grocery business), and trying to create a niche of that market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 401
Webvan’s ability to predict customer acceptance and widespread usage was not based on facts, just untested business plan hypotheses.

Yellow highlight | Location: 404
Here’s the point: Since the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance, their sales and marketing strategies differ dramatically. Even more serious, each Market Type has radically different cash needs. A company creating a new market might be unprofitable for five or more years, while one in an existing market might generate cash in 12-18 months. As a result, the Product Development model is not only useless, it is dangerous. It tells the finance, marketing and sales teams nothing about how to uniquely describe and sell for each type of startup, or how to predict the resources needed for success.

Yellow highlight | Location: 419
Webvan’s failure and the entire dot-com collapse resulted from falling victim to the three expectations I’ve just described; “build it and the customers will come” (regardless of the number of dollars raised) is not a successful strategy.

Yellow highlight | Location: 424
Since the early 1990s, the closest thing to a Holy Grail for sales and marketing activities in startups has been the Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve and the notion of The Chasm.

Yellow highlight | Location: 443
If you are just starting your company this is the last time you are going to see this curve, at least for the next year. The problems you face occur much earlier than any chasm. In fact, you should be so lucky to be dealing with chasm-crossing activities, for they are a sign of success. The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve provides true insight, because there are different types of customers in a company/product life cycle. However, this seductive curve leads early-stage entrepreneurs to four bad conclusions:

Yellow highlight | Location: 447
First, the curve naturally leads entrepreneurs to entertain dreams of glory in the mainstream market. In the early stages of building a company, those dreams are best forgotten. Not forever, but for now. Why? The sad reality is if you don’t get the first part of early Customer Development right, you won’t be in the mainstream. You’ll be out of business.

Yellow highlight | Location: 457
Fourth, the Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve, along with the books written about it, emphasize “execution and adoption.” That’s all fine and good, but as my grandmother used to say, “You should be so lucky to have that problem.” In the early stages of a startup, focusing on “execution” will put you out of business. Instead, you need a “learning and discovery” process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute.

Yellow highlight | Location: 461
So instead of dreaming up ways to cross the chasm, the first step for a startup is to focus on learning and discovery processes, from starting the company to scaling the business. Through trial and error, hiring and firing, startups that succeed have invented a parallel process to Product Development that is customer- and market-centric. I call it “Customer Development.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 472
The Customer Development model of a startup starts with a simple premise: Learning and discovering who a company’s initial customers will be, and what markets they are in, requires a separate and distinct process from Product Development.

Yellow highlight | Location: 477
Before any of the traditional functions of selling and marketing can happen, the company must prove a market could exist, verify someone would pay real dollars for the solutions the company envisions, and then go out and create the market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 487
The ironic postscript to the Webvan story is that another company, Tesco, raced past pioneers such as Webvan to become the largest online grocer in the world. The people at Tesco did not raise a huge financial war chest to launch their service. They learned and discovered what customers wanted, and found a financial model that worked. They started their online grocery service by using their retail stores in the UK as the launching pad. By 2002 they had created a profitable online business handling 85,000 orders per week and had racked up more than $559 million in sales.

In his 20 years of working as a professional office designer, he realized one of the big problems in the furniture industry for design professionals and businesses such as hotels and restaurants was that high-quality designer furniture took four months to ship. Customers repeatedly told Rob, “I wish I could buy great-looking furniture without having to wait months to get

Yellow highlight | Location: 513
In each case, Rob went through his presentation and pointed out there was a $17.5 billion business-to-business market for high-quality, well-designed furnishings.

Yellow highlight | Location: 516
Consumers typically waited four months for product and incurred unnecessary markups of up to 40%. Listening to Rob speak, it was obvious he had identified a real problem, had developed a product that solved that problem, and had customers verifying he had the right solution by buying from him.

Yellow highlight | Location: 522
Design professionals wanted to leaf through a catalog at their leisure in bed. They wanted to show a catalog to their customers. While he wasn’t going to ignore the Web, it would be the next step, not the first, in building the business.

Yellow highlight | Location: 536
Most startups lack a process for discovering their markets, locating their first customers, validating their assumptions, and growing their business. A few successful ones like Design Within Reach do all these things. They succeed by inventing a Customer Development model.

Yellow highlight | Location: 546
Customer Discovery focuses on testing whether a company’s business model is correct, specifically focused on whether the product solves customer problems and needs (this match of product features and customers is called Product/Market fit.) Customer Validation develops a sales model that can be replicated, Customer Creation on creating and driving end-user demand, and Company Building on transitioning the organization from one designed for learning and discovery to a well-oiled machine engineered for execution. As I discuss later in this chapter, integral to this model is the notion that Market Type choices affect how the company will deploy its sales, marketing and financial resources.

Yellow highlight | Location: 553
“Unlike Product Development, finding the right customers and market is unpredictable, and we will screw it up several times before we get it right.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 556
The nature of finding a market and customers guarantees you will get it wrong several times. Therefore, unlike the Product Development model, the Customer Development model assumes it will take several iterations of each of the four steps. It’s worth pondering this point for a moment, because this philosophy of “It’s OK to screw it up if you plan to learn from

Yellow highlight | Location: 563
In contrast, the Customer Development diagram says going backwards is a natural and valuable part of learning and discovery.

Yellow highlight | Location: 565
Notice the circle labeled Customer Validation in Figure 2.1 has an additional iterative loop, or pivot, going back to Customer Discovery. As you’ll see later, Customer Validation is a key checkpoint in understanding whether you have a product customers want to buy and a roadmap of how to sell it. If you can’t find enough paying customers in the Customer Validation step, the model returns you to Customer Discovery to rediscover what customers want and will pay for.

Yellow highlight | Location: 570
In the first two steps of Customer Development, even an infinite amount of cash is useless, because it can only obscure whether you have found a market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 573
Since the Customer Development model assumes most startups cycle through these first two steps at least twice, it allows a well-managed company to carefully estimate and frugally husband its cash. The company doesn’t build its non-Product Development teams (sales, marketing, business development) until it has proof in hand (a tested sales roadmap and valid purchase orders) that it has a business worth building. Once proof is obtained, the company can go through the last two steps of Customer Creation and Company Building to capitalize on the opportunity it has found and validated.

Yellow highlight | Location: 584
Step 1: Customer Discovery The goal of Customer Discovery is just what the name implies: finding out who the customers for your product are and whether the problem you believe you are solving is important to them. More formally, this step involves discovering whether the problem, product and customer hypotheses in your business plan are correct. To do this, you need to leave guesswork behind and get “outside the building” in order to learn what the high-value customer problems are, what about your product solves these problems, and who specifically are your customer and user

Yellow highlight | Location: 592
The job of the Customer Development team is to see whether there are customers and a market for that vision.

Yellow highlight | Location: 595
While these online retailers had Product Development milestones, they lacked formal Customer Development milestones. At Furniture.com the focus was on getting to market first and fast.

Yellow highlight | Location: 600
In contrast, at Design Within Reach Rob Forbes was the consummate proponent of a customer-centric view. Rob was talking to customers and suppliers continually. He didn’t spend time in his office pontificating about a vision for his business. Nor did he go out and start telling customers what products he was going to deliver (the natural instinct of any entrepreneur at this stage). Instead, he was out in the field listening, discovering how his customers worked and what their key problems were.

Yellow highlight | Location: 607
Step 2: Customer Validation Customer Validation is where the rubber meets the road. The goal of this step is to build a repeatable sales roadmap for the sales and marketing teams that will follow later. The sales roadmap is the playbook of the proven and repeatable sales process that has been field-tested by successfully selling the product to early customers. Customer Validation proves you have found a set of customers

Yellow highlight | Location: 611
In essence, Customer Discovery and Customer Validation corroborate your business model. Completing these first two steps verifies your market, locates your customers, tests the perceived value of your product, identifies the economic buyer, establishes your pricing and channel strategy, and checks out your sales cycle and process. If, and only if, you find a group of repeatable customers with a repeatable sales process, and then find those customers yield a profitable business model, do you move to the next step (scaling up and crossing the Chasm).

Yellow highlight | Location: 619
Step 3: Customer Creation Customer Creation builds on the success of the company’s initial sales. Its goal is to create end-user demand and drive that demand into the company’s sales channel. This step is placed after Customer Validation to move heavy marketing spending after the point where a startup acquires its first customers, thus allowing the company to control its cash-burn rate and protect its most precious asset.

Yellow highlight | Location: 624
Some startups enter existing markets well-defined by their competitors, some create new markets where no product or company exists, and some attempt a hybrid of the first two, resegmenting an existing market either as a low-cost entrant or by creating a niche. Each of these Market Type strategies requires a distinctive set of Customer Creation activities.

Yellow highlight | Location: 630
Brand building and heavy advertising make lots of sense in existing markets when customers understand your product or service. However, in a new market this type of “onslaught” product launch is like throwing money down the toilet. Customers have no clue what you are talking about, and you have no idea if they will behave as you assume.

Yellow highlight | Location: 632
Step 4: Company Building Company Building is where the company transitions from its informal, learning and discovery-oriented Customer Development team into formal departments with VPs of Sales, Marketing and Business Development. These executives now focus on building mission-oriented departments exploiting the company’s early market success.

Yellow highlight | Location: 645
At Design Within Reach, Rob Forbes ran the company on a shoestring. The burn rate was kept low, first as a necessity as he scraped together financing, and then by plan as his team was finding a sales roadmap that could scale. Rob was finding a way to sell furniture without a network of stores - it was called a catalog.

Yellow highlight | Location: 651
Startups that are entering an existing market Startups that are creating an entirely new market Startups that want to resegment an existing market as a low-cost entrant Startups that want to resegment an existing market as a niche player (“Disruptive” and “sustaining” innovations, eloquently described by Clayton Christensen, are another way to define new and existing Market Types.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 655
It is a fallacy to believe the strategy and tactics that worked for one startup should be appropriate in another. That’s because Market Type changes everything a company does.

Yellow highlight | Location: 661
The VP of Marketing looked at all the other PDAs on the market and differentiated Handspring’s product by emphasizing expandability and performance. End result?

Yellow highlight | Location: 662
After 12 months Handspring’s revenue was $170 million. This was possible because in 1999 Donna and Handspring were in an existing market. Handspring’s customers understood what a Personal Digital Assistant was. Handspring did not have to educate them about the market, just why their new product was better than the competition - and they did it brilliantly.

Yellow highlight | Location: 670
The VP of Marketing might have said, “Let’s tell everyone about how fast the Palm Personal Digital Assistant is.” If they had done this there would have been no sales. In 1996 no potential customer had heard of a Personal Digital Assistant. No one knew what a PDA could do, there was no latent demand from end users, and emphasizing its technical features would have been irrelevant. Palm needed to educate potential customers about what a PDA could do for them. By our definition (a product that allows users to do something they couldn’t do before), Palm in 1996 created a new market. In contrast, Handspring in 1999 was in an existing market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 681
Before any sales or marketing activities can begin, a company must keep testing and asking, “What kind of a startup are we?” To see why, consider the four possible “Market Types.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 682
A New Product in an Existing Market An existing market is easy to understand. You are in an existing market if your product offers higher performance than what is currently offered. Higher performance can be a product or service that runs faster, does something better or substantially improves on what is already on the market. The good news is the users and the market are known, but so are the competitors. In fact, competitors define the market. The basis of competition is therefore all about the product and product features. You can enter an existing market with a cheaper or repositioned “niche” product, but if that is the case we call it a resegmented market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 688
A New Product in a New Market Another possibility is to introduce a new product into a new market. A new market results when a company creates a large customer base that couldn’t do something before. This happens because of true innovation, creating something brand-new; dramatically lower cost, creating a new class of users;

Yellow highlight | Location: 691
Compaq’s first portable computers allowed business executives to take their computers with them, something simply impossible previously. Compaq created a new market, the portable computer market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 694
(By “created the market” I do not mean “first-to-market”; I mean the company whose market share and ubiquity are associated with the market.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 696
In a new market the good news is your product features are at first irrelevant because there are no competitors (except other pesky startups). The bad news is the users and the market are undefined and unknown. If you’re creating a new market, your problem isn’t how to compete with other companies on product features but how to convince a set of customers your vision is not a hallucination.

Yellow highlight | Location: 702
A New Product Attempting to Resegment an Existing Market: Low Cost Over half of startups pursue the hybrid course of attempting to introduce a new product that resegments an existing market. Resegmenting a market can take two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche strategy. (Segmentation is not the same as differentiation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, understandable, and, most important, concerns something they value and want and need now.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 706
Low-cost resegmentation is just what it sounds like—are there customers at the low-end of an existing marketing who will buy “good enough” performance if they could get it at a substantially lower price?

Yellow highlight | Location: 709
A New Product Attempting to Resegment an Existing Market: Niche Niche resegmentation is slightly different. It looks at an existing market and asks, “Would some part of this market buy a new product designed to address their specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or worse performance in an aspect of the product irrelevant to this niche?’ Niche resegmentation attempts to convince customers some characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules and shape of an existing market. Unlike low-cost resegmentation, niche goes after the core of an existing market’s profitable business.

Yellow highlight | Location: 716
Yet In-n-Out succeeded by simply observing the incumbent players had strayed from their original concept of a hamburger chain. By 2001 McDonald’s had over 55 menu items and not one of them tasted particularly great. In stark contrast, In-n-Out offered three items: all fresh, high-quality and great tasting. They focused on the core fast-food segment that wanted high-quality hamburgers and nothing else.

Yellow highlight | Location: 719
While resegmenting an existing market is the most common Market Type choice of new startups, it’s also the trickiest. As a low-end resegmentation strategy, it needs a long-term product plan that uses low cost as market entry to eventual profitability and up-market growth.

Yellow highlight | Location: 724
all startups, regardless of Market Type, leave the building and talk to customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 729
The speed with which a company moves through the Customer Development process also depends on Market Type.

Yellow highlight | Location: 732
In contrast, a company creating a new market has an open-ended set of questions. Completing the Customer Development processes may take a year or two, or even longer.

Yellow highlight | Location: 737
“Market Type” Characteristics (Table 2.2)

Yellow highlight | Location: 742
For a startup to succeed, Product and Customer Development must remain synchronized and operate in concert.

Yellow highlight | Location: 744
Engineering’s job in large companies is to make follow-on products for an existing market. A follow-on product starts with several things already known: who the customers are, what they need, what markets they are in, and who the company’s competitors are.

Yellow highlight | Location: 748
In contrast, most startups can only guess who their customers are and what markets they are in. The only certainty on day one is the product vision. It follows, then, the goal of Customer Development in a startup is to find a market for the product as spec’d, not to develop or refine a spec based on a market that is unknown. This is a fundamental difference between a big company and most startups.

Yellow highlight | Location: 764
In Customer Discovery, the Customer Development team strives to validate the product spec, not come up with a new set of features. Only if customers do not agree there’s a problem to be solved, think the problem is not painful,

Yellow highlight | Location: 771
The Customer Development model consists of four well-defined steps: Customer Discovery, Customer Validation, Customer Creation, and Company Building. As you will see in succeeding chapters, each of these steps has a set of clear, concise deliverables giving the company and its investors incontrovertible proof that progress is being made on the customer front. Moreover, the first three steps of Customer Development can be accomplished with a staff that can fit in a phone booth. While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole has one overarching goal: proving there is a profitable, scalable business for the company. This is what propels the company from nonprofit to moneymaking endeavor.

Yellow highlight | Location: 802
Steve and his team made one of the standard startup mistakes. They had developed a great product, but neglected to spend an equivalent amount of time developing the market. The home office market simply had no compelling need that made Front Desk a “must-have,” especially at a high price.

Yellow highlight | Location: 810
While the new strategy sounded great on paper, it suffered from the same problem as the first: The product might be nice to have, but it did not solve a compelling problem. Vice Presidents of Sales at major corporations were not going to bed at night worrying about their remote offices. They were worrying about how to make their sales numbers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 813
What ensued was the startup version of the ritualized Japanese Noh play I mentioned in Chapter 1. Faced with the failure of Plan B, FastOffice fired the VP of Marketing and came up with yet another new strategy. The company was now on the startup Death Spiral:

Yellow highlight | Location: 820
Like most startups, FastOffice knew how to build a product and how to measure progress toward the product ship date. What the company lacked was a set of early Customer Development goals that would have allowed it to measure its progress in understanding customers and finding a market for its product. These goals would have been achieved when FastOffice could answer four questions: Have we identified a problem a customer wants solved? Does our product solve these customer needs? If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model? Have we learned enough to go out and sell?

Yellow highlight | Location: 828
But most of what a startup’s founders initially believe about their market and potential customers are just educated guesses.

Yellow highlight | Location: 830
So the general goal of Customer Discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses about their business model, market and customers into facts. And since the facts live outside the building, the primary activity is to get in front of customers, partners and suppliers. Only after the founders have performed this step will they know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.

Yellow highlight | Location: 850
In established companies, the MRD process ensures engineering will build a product that appeals to an existing market. In this case the customers and their needs are known. In a startup, the first product is not designed to satisfy a mainstream customer

Yellow highlight | Location: 854
successful startup solves this conundrum by focusing its development on building the product incrementally and iteratively and targets its early selling efforts on a very small group of early customers who have bought into the startup’s vision.

Yellow highlight | Location: 859
Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers You’ll Ever Know Earlyvangelists are a special breed of customer willing to take a risk on your startup’s product or service because they can envision its potential to solve a critical and immediate problem—and they have the budget to purchase it.

Yellow highlight | Location: 880
You’re almost there: You’ve found a customer who has such a desperate problem he has had his own homegrown solution built out of piece parts.

Yellow highlight | Location: 886
Earlyvangelists can be identified by these customer characteristics (see Figure 3.1): The customer has a problem The customer understands he or she has a problem The customer is actively searching for a solution and has a timetable for finding it The problem is painful enough the customer has cobbled together an interim solution The customer has committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to solve the problem

Yellow highlight | Location: 920
To sum up the Customer Discovery philosophy: In sharp contrast to the MRD approach of building a product for a wide group of customers, a successful startup’s first release is designed to be “good enough only for our first paying customers.” The purpose of Customer Discovery is to identify those key visionary customers, understand their needs, and verify your product solves a problem they are willing to pay to have solved—or not. Meanwhile, you start development based on your initial vision, using your visionary customers to test whether that vision has a market. And you adjust your vision according to what you learn.

Yellow highlight | Location: 937
Phase 1 is a rigorous process of writing a series of briefs that capture the hypotheses embodied in your company’s vision and business model. These hypotheses are the assumptions about your product, customers, pricing, demand, market, and competition you will test in the remainder of this step.

Yellow highlight | Location: 940
In Phase 2 you qualify those assumptions by testing them in front of potential customers. At this point you want to do very little talking and a lot of listening. Your goal is to understand your customers and their problems, and arrive at a deep understanding of their business, workflow, organization, and product needs. You then return to your company, integrate all you learned, update Engineering with customer feedback, and jointly revise your product and customer briefs.

Yellow highlight | Location: 943
In Phase 3 you take your revised product concept and test its features in front of customers. The goal is not to sell the product but to validate the Phase 1 hypotheses by having customers say, “Yes, these features solve our problems.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 950
Finally, in Phase 4 you stop and verify you understand customers’ problems, that the product solves those problems, customers will pay for the product, and that the resulting revenue will result in a profitable business model.

If, and only if, you are successful in this step do you proceed to Customer Validation.

At first, this “team” may consist of the company’s technical founder who moves out to talk with customers while five engineers write code

Yellow highlight | Location: 973
Complementing the Customer Development team is a startup’s product execution team. While Customer Development is out of the building talking with customers, the product team is focused on creating the product. Often this team is headed by the product visionary who leads the development effort. As you will see, regular communication between Customer Development and product execution is critical.

Yellow highlight | Location: 979
Consequently, before your company can embark on Customer Development as a formal process, you must get all the players educated. There must be agreement between investors and founders about the process, key hires, and values.

Yellow highlight | Location: 983
The Product Development process emphasizes execution. The Customer Development process emphasizes learning, discovery, failure, iterations and pivots.

Yellow highlight | Location: 986
Unique to the process is the commitment of the Product Development team to spend at least 15% of its time outside the building talking to customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 991
When the company is confused about what product to build or what market you wanted to serve, refer to the mission statement. This is called mission-oriented leadership. In times of crisis or confusion, understanding why the company exists and what its goals are will provide a welcome beacon of clarity.

Once the company has bought into Customer Development as a process in Phase 0, the next phase of Customer Discovery is to write down all of your company’s initial assumptions, or hypotheses.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,009
the following areas: Product Customer and their problem Channel and pricing Demand creation Market Type Competition

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,016
Product hypotheses consist of the founding team’s initial guesses about the product and its development. Something like these were part of the company’s original business plan.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,052
These are important because the Customer Development team will be out trying to convince a small group of early customers to buy based on the product spec long before you can physically deliver the product. To do so they will have to paint a picture for customers of what the product will ultimately look like several releases into the future. It’s because these customers are buying into your total vision that they will give you money for an incomplete, buggy, barely functional first product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,068
The process of assembling the customer briefs is the same as for the product brief, except this time the Customer Development team is writing down its initial assumptions. These assumptions cover two key areas: who the customers are (the customer hypothesis) and what problems they have (the problem hypothesis).

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,071
In the course of Customer Discovery, you’ll flesh out these assumptions with additional information: Types of customers Customer problems A day in the life of your customers Organizational map and customer influence map ROI (return on investment) justification Minimum feature set Again, let’s consider each part of the customer and problem briefs in turn.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,083
Customer Types (Figure

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,103
I call this group the saboteurs. In every large company, for example, there are individuals and organizations that are wedded to the status quo. If your product threatens a department’s stability, headcount, or budget, don’t expect this group to welcome you with open arms. Therefore you need to be able to predict who might be most threatened by your product, understand their influence in the organization, and ultimately put together a sales strategy that at worst neutralizes their influence and at best turns them into allies.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,108
The first step in formulating your customer brief is to write down and diagram who you think will be your day-to-day users, influencers, recommenders, economic buyer, and decision-maker, including, in the case of sales to companies, their titles and where in the organization they are found.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,116
Customer Hypotheses: Types of Customers for Consumer Products Some consumer products (clothing, fashion, entertainment products, etc.) don’t address a “problem,” or need. In fact, U.S. consumers spend over 40 percent of their income on discretionary purchases, i.e. luxuries. How to sell to consumers starts with identifying customer types as described above.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,122
Describe how you can convince these customers that your product can deliver an emotional payoff.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,123
Customer Hypotheses: Customer Problems Next, you want to understand what problem the customer has. The reason is simple: It’s much easier to sell when you can build the story about your product’s features and benefits around a solution to a problem you know the customer already has. Then you look less like a crass entrepreneur and more like someone who cares coming in with a potentially valuable solution.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,140
These examples show that you need to summarize the customer‘s problem, and the organizational impact of the problem in terms of the different types of pain it causes at various levels of the company/family/consumer. Finally, writing down the answer to “If they could wave a magic wand and change anything at all, what would it be?” gives you a tremendous leg up on how to present your new product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,144
In this customer problem brief, you use a simple “problem recognition scale” for each type of customer (user, influencer, recommender, economic buyer, decision-maker). As you learn more you can begin to categorize your customers as having: A latent need (the customers have a problem or they have a problem and understand they have a problem) An active need (the customers recognize a problem—they are in pain—and are actively searching for a solution, but they haven’t done any serious work to solve the problem) A vision (the customers have an idea what a solution to the problem would look like, may even have cobbled together a homegrown solution, and, in the best case, are prepared to pay for a better solution)

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,149
Now that you are firmly ensconced in thinking through your customers’ problems, look at the problem from one other perspective: Are you solving a mission-critical company problem or satisfying a must-have consumer need?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,217
Customer Hypotheses: Minimum Feature Set The last part of your customer/problem brief is one the Product Development team will be surprised to see. You want to understand the smallest feature set customers will pay for in the first release. The minimum feature set is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups ask of their development teams. Usually the cry is for more features, typically based on “here’s what I heard from the last customer I visited.” In the Customer Development model, however, the premise is that a very small group of early visionary customers will guide your follow-on features. So your mantra becomes, “Less is more, to get an earlier first release.” Rather than asking customers explicitly about feature X, Y or Z, one approach to defining the minimum features set is to ask, “What is the smallest or least complicated problem the customer will pay us to solve?”

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,242
A startup picks a sales channel with three criteria in mind: (1) Does the channel add value to the sales process? (2) What are the price and the complexity of the product? And (3) Are there established customer buying habits/practices? In a “value-added” channel the channel may provide one-on-one sales contacts, special services such as installation, repair or integration. In contrast, a “shrink-wrapped” product is often purchased directly from catalogs, online or from store floor displays.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,282
You also need to understand how your customers hear about new companies and products. Do they go to trade shows? Do others in their company go? What magazines do they read? Which ones do they trust? What do their bosses read? Who are the best salespeople they know? Who would they hire to call on them?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,284
Demand Creation Hypotheses: Influencers At times the most powerful pressure on a customer’s buying decision may not be something your company did directly. It may be something someone who did not work for you said or did not say. In every market or industry there is a select group of individuals who pioneer the trends, style, and opinions. They may be paid pundits in market research firms. They may be kids who wear the latest fashions. In this brief you need to identify the influencers who can affect your customer’s opinions. Your brief includes the list of outside influencers: analysts, bloggers, journalists, and so on. Who are the visionaries in social media or the blogger, press/analyst community customers read and listen to? That they respect? This list will also become your roadmap for assembling an advisory board as well as targeting key industry analysts and press contacts in the Customer Validation step.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,292
In Chapter 2, I introduced the concept of Market Type. Startup companies generally enter one of four Market Types and ultimately your company will need to choose one of these. However, unlike decisions about product features, the Market Type is a “late-binding-decision.” This means you can defer this final decision until Customer Creation but you still need a working hypothesis.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,296
However, because the consequences of the wrong choice are severe, you would be wise to develop initial Market Type hypotheses you can test as you move through the Customer Development phase. To do this, the Customer Development team should record its initial Market Type and brainstorm with the Product Development team. In this brief, you will seek a provisional answer to a single question: Is your company entering an existing market, resegmenting an existing market or creating a new market?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,300
For some startups the choice is pretty clear. If you are entering a market where you are in a “clone business,” such as computers or PDAs, the choice is already made for you: you are in an existing market. If you have invented a radically new class of product no one has seen before, you are likely in a new market. However, most companies have the luxury to choose which Market Type to use. So how to choose? A few simple questions begin the process: Is there an established and well-defined market with large numbers of customers? Does your product have better “something” (performance, features, service) than the existing competitors? If so, you are in an existing market. Is there an established and well-defined market with large numbers of customers and your product costs less than the incumbents’? You are in a resegmented market. Is there an established and well-defined market with large numbers of customers where your product can be uniquely differentiated from the existing incumbents? You are also in a resegmented market. If there is no established and well-defined market, with no existing competitors you are creating a new market. Don’t worry if you waver among the four Market Type choices. As you start talking to customers, they will have lots of opinions about where you fit. For now, go through each of the market types and pick the one that best fits your vision today. Table 3.1, which you saw in Chapter 2, is a reminder of the tradeoffs. Market Type (Table 3.1) Market Type Hypotheses: Entering An Existing Market

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,332
Market Type Hypotheses: Resegmenting An Existing Market An alternative to going head to head with the market leaders in an existing market may be to resegment an existing market. Here your positioning will rest on either a) the claim of being the “low-cost provider” or b) finding a niche via positioning (some feature of your product or service redefines the existing market so you have a unique competitive advantage). If you believe you are resegmenting an existing market, good questions to address in this brief include: What existing markets are your customers coming from? What are the unique characteristics of those customers? What compelling needs of those customers are unmet by existing suppliers? What compelling features of your product will get customers of existing companies to abandon their current supplier? Why couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing? How long will it take you to educate potential customers and grow a market of sufficient size? What size is that? How will you educate the market? How will you create demand? Given no customers yet exist in your new segment, what are realistic year one-through-three sales forecasts? For this type of startup, you need to draw both the competitive diagram

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,346
A resegmented market assumes it is going to get customers from an existing market. Draw the existing markets from which you expect to get your customers (remember a market is a set of companies with common attributes.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,350
Market Type Hypotheses: Entering a New Market At first glance, a new market has great appeal. What could be better than a market with no competitors? And no competition typically means pricing is not a competitive issue but one of what the market will bear. Wow, no competitors and high margins! Yet even without competitors the risks of market failure are great. Without sounding pedantic, creating a new market means a market does not currently exist—there are no customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,361
As I noted in Chapter 2, you compete in a new market not by besting other companies with your product features, but by convincing a set of customers your vision is not a hallucination and solves a real problem they have or could be convinced they have. However, “who the users are” and the “definition of the market” itself are undefined and unknown. Here the key is to use your competitive brief to define a new market with your company in the center.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,365
F State Your Hypotheses: Competitive Hypotheses Next, the Customer Development team assembles a competitive brief. Remember, if you are entering an existing market or resegmenting one, the basis of competition is all about some attribute(s) of your product. Therefore you need to know how and why your product is better than those of your competitors. This brief helps you focus on answering that question. (If you are entering a new market, doing a competitive analysis is like dividing by zero; there are no direct competitors.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,371
Take a look at the market you are going to enter and estimate how much market share the existing players have. Does any single entrant have 30 percent? Over 80 percent? These are magic numbers. When the share of the largest player in a market is around 30 percent or less, there is no single dominant company. You have a shot at entering this market. When one company owns over 80 percent share (think Microsoft), that player is the owner of the market and a monopolist. The only possible move you have is resegmenting this market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,394
In this phase the Customer Development team begins to test and qualify the hypotheses assembled in Phase 1. I use the phrase “test and qualify assumptions,” because very rarely do hypotheses survive customer feedback intact.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,401
Instead, your first set of customer meetings isn’t to learn whether customers love your product. It’s to learn whether your assumptions about the problems customers have are correct. If those assumptions are wrong, it doesn’t matter how wonderful the product is; no one will buy it.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,409
Start by making a list of 50 potential customers you can test your ideas on. Fifty names sounds like a lot of leads, but as you’ll soon see, you’ll go through them quickly. Where do you get these names? From your social networks, friends, investors, founders, lawyers, recruiters, trade magazines, business reference books, accountants, and any other source you can think of.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,424
Remember, the ultimate goal in this Customer Discovery step is to make sure you understand the customers problem(s) and to ensure your product as spec’d solves that problem.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,444
Obviously, you will need to vary and tweak the story, but the goal remains the same: Get meetings scheduled. This may sound easy on paper, but if you are not a professional salesperson, it can be very hard. I hated calling people I didn’t know. I would stare at the phone, walk around it, pick it up, and put it down without calling. But eventually I placed the calls. And you know what? There is nothing more satisfying than a potential customer saying, “Why, yes, that’s exactly the problem we have. I can spare twenty minutes to chat—why don’t you come in Tuesday.” Yes!

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,452
As a rule of thumb, your 50 follow-up phone calls should yield five-10 scheduled visits. You will use these visits to test your customer/problem hypotheses—who your customers are and why they will use your product. These visits are a first step toward achieving a deep understanding of how customers work, their problems, their organization, and how they fit in their company.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,460
In contrast to a product presentation, a problem presentation isn’t designed to convince customers. Instead, you develop it to elicit information from customers. The presentation summarizes your hypotheses about customers’ problems,

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,476
If they agree with you about the problems, get them to explain why they think it is important to solve them (there is nothing better than playing validated customer needs back to them). Casually ask, “How much does this problem cost you (in terms of lost revenue, lost customers, lost time, frustration, etc.) today?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,491
RoboVac’s earlyvangelists wanted to leave their vacuum running, and come home and find a completely clean floor.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,499
My favorite summary of this discussion is to ask two questions I alluded to earlier: “What is the biggest pain in how you work (or in RoboVac’s case—how you clean)? If you could wave a magic wand and change anything in what you do, what would it be?” I call these the “IPO questions.” Understand the answers to these questions and your startup is going public.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,516
You also want to check your assumptions about whether people will pay for your solution. What would make customers change the current way they do things? Price? Features? A new standard?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,525
Your goal, after enough of these customer conversations, is to be able to stand up in front of your company and say, “Here were our hypotheses about our customers, their problems, and how they worked. Now here’s what they are saying their issues really are, and this is how they really spend their day.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,531
once worked in a startup building a new type of supercomputer. One of the markets we had picked was the arcane field of production geology. Since I knew nothing about the field, I realized before I could even hire a domain expert to manage this market, I needed to get educated in depth. I traveled to all the petroleum geology trade shows and conferences, I spoke to customer after customer to understand their needs. I spent days in the Houston petroleum engineering library. Just when I thought I knew enough to fake it as a technical expert in this area, I convinced Chevron’s La Habra research center to allow me to offer their research group a two-hour course on the use of graphics supercomputers in petroleum applications.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,546
Now that you have a good understanding of the customer and their problem you want to round out your understanding of the overall marketplace. You need to meet with companies in adjacent markets, industry analysts, people in the press, and other key influencers. Going to industry trade shows and conferences is also key to help you understand the shape and direction of the market you are in or about to create.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,561
Next, start gathering quantitative data about your market. More than likely Wall Street analysts issue reports on your market or adjacent markets. Get copies of all these reports. More important, read them. You need to understand what the analysts believe are the trends, the players, business models, and key metrics. Finally, industry conferences and trade shows are invaluable and essential. Never say, “I’m too busy to attend.” Attend at least two key conferences or tradeshows (you picked the important ones in Phase 1).

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,567
You want to get demos of competitive and adjacent products. You want to get your hands on them, get competitors’ literature, talk to their salespeople, and generally immerse yourself in the business you are entering.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,581
Before the meeting, the Customer Development team gathers all the customer data and builds a workflow map of the prototypical customer. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the team diagrams and describes how customers do their jobs and who they interact with.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,588
Draw the customer workflow with and without your product. Was the difference dramatic? Did customers say they would pay for that difference? In general, what did you learn about customers’ problems? What were the biggest surprises? What were the biggest disappointments?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,590
Once the Customer Development team has presented its findings, the fun begins. You can now ask the most difficult question, “Do we have product/market fit?” Given all you have learned talking to customers, how well do your preliminary product specs solve their problems? Dead on? Somewhat? Not exactly? If the answer is somewhat or not exactly, this meeting becomes a painful, soul-searching, company-building exercise.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,606
Remember, in a startup the Customer Development team is not supposed to add features; it is supposed to find out the minimum feature set for the first release, based on input from visionary customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,621
Accordingly, develop a solution-oriented presentation that describes the product in terms of solving the customer’s problem.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,652
Since your company will be spending a ton of money and lots of time trying to figure out how to position your product, why not ask these customers what they think? After hearing your product description, how do they think your product is different? Do they think you are creating a new market? Or do they think the product is a better version of an existing product (and, if so, better in what way)? Or do they shrug and say, “It’s somewhere in the middle, comparable to others, but it doesn’t change the rules of the game”?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,672
OK, you’ve talked about pricing. Now, what about distribution? Test your assumptions by asking customers what channel they would most likely use to buy your product. Retail store? From the Web? Direct sales? From there, ask customers how you would reach them via marketing: “If you were interested in a product like this, how would you find out about it? How do you find out about other new products like this? Do you ask others for their opinions before buying? If so, who? Do you or your staff go to trade shows?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,696
For products in an existing market, it’s easy to tell them, “It’s like that other one you sell, but faster.” For resegmented and new markets, indirect channels have a harder time understanding how to position your product. Make sure you spend the time helping them.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,724
As a startup, your goal and battle cry should be “fast to market.” Fast to market simply means getting your first release in the hands of paying customers as quickly as you can.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,730
This fast-to-market strategy is distinctly different from a first-to-market strategy. First-to-market emphasizes competing with other startups to win market share quickly by low price, discounting, and the liberal use of marketing dollars in establishing a brand. Its key theme, whether explicit or not, is “get customers at any price.” In contrast, fast-to-market says if a new market is large, whoever wins the first few sales is not going to matter. What matters is learning how to make money from day one.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,752
If Steve had spent the time thinking about those up front, or at least after he received customer feedback, FastOffice would still be in business.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,754
As good as your founding team is, there are invaluable people outside your company you can’t hire as full-time employees, but who will be willing to help in an advisory capacity. These advisors can help solve technical problems, introduce you to key customers, provide you with domain-specific knowledge, and share business expertise and wisdom. Early in Customer Discovery, as you began to meet customers and analysts, you began to think about who might fit on an advisory board

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,759
And as you begin to talk to customers, you’ll realize that out of the morass of meetings you’ve been having, one or two voices stood out from the crowd. In this phase, you informally engage these people by asking them for advice, taking them to lunch and seeing if they are interested in helping you and your company.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,766
Now, in Phase 4, you summarize your findings by verifying what you’ve found about the problem and product, and spend time thinking about whether the business model still makes financial sense if you operate it under the conditions you have discovered thus far. So, in this phase, you do four things: Verify the problem Verify the product solution Verify the business model Assess whether to iterate or exit

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,770
By now, you have talked to at least 10 or 20 customers, more if you have traveled the Customer Discovery loop more than once. “Verifying the problem” simply means summarizing everything you have learned and checking to see whether you have the problem nailed or need to go around the loop again.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,776
“Verifying the product solution” means summarizing everything you’ve learned about your product hypotheses. The short test for exiting Customer Discovery is to gather your executive team in a conference room. Raise your left hand and in a loud voice yell out the top three customer problems. Then raise your right hand and yell out the top three product features. Look at the faces of your team and see if the shock of the two hands not matching is evident. If so, and you lack product/market fit, and need to get back in front of customers; if not, go to the next step.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,782
Given the customer feedback to date, do your current product plans meet the needs of the market?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,786
If you have gotten this far, you’re probably feeling pretty cocky. You understand the customer’s problem, you believe you’ve nailed the product features, and the resulting vision matches significant customer needs. However, there is the small matter of making money. When you originally put together your business plan, that wonderful multipage spreadsheet you gave your investors was your financial hypothesis. Now you get to rerun that financial model based on customer feedback and test how real your business model is.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,799
What is the market size? If you are creating a new market, what is the size of the closest adjacent markets? Can you be that large? Larger? If you are expanding an existing market, what is the size of the current market? Is the market still large enough for your revenue projections?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,808
Now it’s time to honestly assess if your modified hypotheses provide a sound foundation for moving forward. Have we identified a problem a customer wants solved? Does our product solve these customer needs? If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model? Can we draw a day in the life of our customer before and after purchase of our product? Can we create an organizational chart of users, buyers and channels?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,812
Exhausting as the Customer Discovery process is, you may need to iterate it multiple times. Do you understand the market and have customers who cannot wait to buy? If not, take everything you learned in Phases 1 through 3, modify your presentations based on feedback, go back to Phase 1 and do it again. Try out several markets and users. Do you need to reconfigure or repackage the product offering? If so, modify your product presentations and go back to Phase 3 (product presentation) and do it again.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,824

“You need to pick up the phone and call the top five accounts on your sales pipeline. Ask them this: If you give them your product today for free, are they prepared to install and use it across their department and company? If the answer is no, you have absolutely no customers on your forecast who will be prepared to buy from you in the next six months.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,887
(You never want a board to have to tell you how to run your company. When that happens, it’s time to update your resume.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,912
In the Customer Validation step, you are not going to staff a sales team. You are not going to execute to a sales plan, and you are definitely not going to execute your “sales strategy.” You simply do not know enough to do any of these things. You may have hypotheses about who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy, but until you validate them, they are merely educated guesses.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,917
The reality is you care less about generating revenue at this point than you do about finding a scalable and repeatable sales process and business model. Building a roadmap to sales success, rather than building a sales organization, is the heart of Customer Validation.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,937
A sales roadmap answers the basic questions involved in selling your product: Are we sure we have product/market fit? Who influences a sale? Who recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? Who is the saboteur? Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling? How many sales calls are needed per sale? How long does an average sale take from beginning to end? What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale? If so what are “key customer problems”? What is the profile of the optimal visionary buyer, the earlyvangelist every startup needs?

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,945
You cannot learn and discover while you are executing. As we can see from the example of InLook, and from the rubble of any number of failed startups, attempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,956
In enterprise or BtoB sales, if the founding team does not include someone with the skill to close an account, the company can hire a “sales closer,” a salesperson with the skills to close a deal.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,958
Early Sales Are to Earlyvangelists, Not Mainstream Customers In Customer Validation, your startup is focused on finding the visionary customers and getting them to make a purchase. Unlike “mainstream” customers who want to buy a finished, completed, and tested product, earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy from a startup.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,969
In exchange, you will not only get an order and great feedback, but visionary customers will become earlyvangelists inside their companies and throughout their industry—or as consumers, to their friends and neighbors. Treated correctly they are the ultimate reference accounts. (Until you reach the Chasm in Chapter 6.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,975
The earlyvangelists you need to talk to are the people I described in Customer Discovery—the ones who are in operating roles, have a problem, have been looking for a solution, have tried to solve the problem and have a budget.

Yellow highlight | Location: 1,999
From your customer’s perspective, what does your company stand for, what does your product do, and why should I care? You probably had an idea when you started the company, but now you have some real experience interacting with customers, and it’s time to revisit your vision in light of what you have learned. Can you reduce your business to a single, clear, compelling message that says why your company is different and your product is worth buying? That’s the goal of a value proposition

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,005
This value proposition will appear in all your sales materials from here on out. It is the sum of all you have learned about product/market fit in Customer Discovery.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,015
InLook’s value proposition was, “Helping chief financial officers manage profitability.” Short and to the point, it played right to the audience InLook was going after. A value proposition is (ideally) one sentence,

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,023
In technology startups, one of the biggest challenges for engineers is to realize they want an oversimplified message, one that grabs customers’ hearts and wallets, not their heads and calculators.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,024
Second, does your value proposition make or reinforce an economic case? Does it have economic impact? Does it sound like your product gives a corporate customer a competitive advantage or improves some critical area in their company? If it’s a consumer product, does it save a consumer time or money, or change their prestige or identity?

Finally, does the value proposition pass the reality test? Claims like “lose 30 pounds as fat just melts away,” “sales will increase 200 percent” or “cut costs by 50 percent” strain credibility.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,033
One last thing to keep in mind is our continual question about Market Type. If you are offering a new product in an existing market, your value proposition is about incremental performance. Incremental value propositions describe improvements and metrics of individual attributes of the product or service (i.e., faster, better). If you are creating a new market, or trying to reframe an existing one, you will probably come up with a transformational value proposition. Transformational value propositions deal with how the solution will create a new level or class of activity—i.e. something people could not do before.

the collateral plan distinguishes with whom each collateral piece will be used and when in the sales process it will be used.

It’s helpful to realize visionary customers require different materials than mainstream customers. Visionary customers are first buying the vision and then the product. Therefore, make sure your materials are clear and detailed enough on the vision and benefits so your earlyvangelists

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,079
Keep in mind at this stage the core audience is earlyvangelists, not mainstream customers. The sales presentation to visionary customers should cover a brief outline of the problem, possible solutions to the problem, your solution to the problem, and product details. It should run no more than 30 minutes.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,083
All the Customer Development team needs is a slide-based “dummy-demo” to illustrate the key points. I rarely have sold to earlyvangelists successfully without having one.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,085
It’s easy to confuse “product data sheets,” which detail product features and benefits, with “solution data sheets,” which address customer problems and big-picture solutions. If you are bringing a new product to an existing market, your focus will be on the product, so you should develop product data sheets. If you are creating a new market, the problem and solution data sheets are more appropriate. And if you are redefining a market, you need both.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,103
Back in the Customer Discovery step, you refined your hypothesis about distribution channels using the information you learned in customer interviews. This phase assumes you have evaluated all the distribution channel alternatives and narrowed your distribution channel choices to one specific sales channel. Now you use that information to develop a preliminary channel plan.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,156
Channel Management Your ability to manage your distribution channel will directly affect your ability to deliver on your revenue plan. Although every company’s goal is a well-managed and carefully selected channel, failure to select the right channel or to control the channel often results in miserable sales revenue and unanticipated channel costs.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,171
Your goal is to determine who your true customers are and how they will purchase your product. You’re ready to begin building a sales team only when you completely understand the process that transforms a prospect into a purchaser and know you can sell the product at a price that supports your business model. With the sales roadmap in their hands, your sales force will be able to focus on actual sales instead of the hit-and-miss experimentation you will experience as you move through Customer Validation.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,184
Organization and Influence Maps Remember the organization and influence map briefs you created in Customer Discovery? Pull them off the wall and study your findings. By now your early hypotheses have been modified to reflect the reality you encountered as you spoke with potential customers. Use this information to develop a working model of the purchase process for your target customer.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,194
The bad news: Multiple “Yes” votes were required to get an E.piphany order. Other enterprise software like sales automation or customer support just needed support from a single key executive or from a single user community to drive a sale to closure.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,223
Customer Access Map Now turn your attention to answering the proverbial sales question: How do you get your foot in the door? For a corporation, depending on the size of the organization you are approaching you may need to move through different layers or departments before you can set up meetings with the people you identified in the organization and influence maps.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,233
Sales Strategy Lay your corporate/consumer organization map and influence map side by side. For a corporate sale, your challenge is to move beyond the names and titles of the people you will call on to develop a strategy of how you will approach them.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,244
Again, as you move out into the marketplace to sell your product, you will learn what works or not. As predictable patterns emerge, your strategy will become clear.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,245
Implementation Plan You’ve made the sale, the visionary customer has said thumbs up. Don’t open the champagne quite yet. Much can happen between when the decision-maker agrees to make a purchase and you receive the check. The goal of the implementation plan is to write down all the things left to happen before the sale is finalized and the product delivered, and to determine who will follow up to manage them.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,252
most startups it’s likely the founding team is product-oriented and does not include a sales professional. While the founders can get quite far in finding visionary customers, they usually have no skill or experience turning that relationship into the first order. Now that you are about to sell, a key question is, does someone on the founding team have experience closing deals? Does the team have a word-class set of customer contacts? Would you bet the company on the founders’ ability to close the first sales? If not, hire a sales closer. A sales closer is not a VP of Sales who wants to immediately build and manage a large sales organization. A sales closer is someone with a great Rolodex in the market you are selling into. Good sales closers are aggressive, want a great compensation package for success, and have no interest in building a sales organization. Typically, they are experienced startup salespeople who love closing deals and aren’t yet ready to retire behind a desk.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,259
The founding team and sales closer make up the core of the Customer Development team. It becomes their job to learn and discover enough information to build the sales and channel roadmaps. You may want to go once around the Customer Validation loop without a sales closer. Then when you understand where the lack of sales skills is stunting progress, hire the closer.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,269
Engineering Schedule, Product Deliverables, and Philosophy In order to sell to visionary customers as part of Customer Validation, the Customer Development team is about to commit to “ship dates” to these customers. Now is the time to verify that your Product Development team is absolutely sure you can deliver a functional product for your early visionary sales.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,293
The second reason for this “good enough” philosophy is this first product is for earlyvangelists, not mainstream users who often have different expectations of what features are important.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,304
First, Customer Development’s job is to find a market for the product as spec’d and to ask for more features only if a market cannot be found. Second, Customer Development has agreed the first release of the product will be incomplete, and the early visionary customers will help everyone understand the next release.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,310
Keep in mind this notion of an “incomplete first release” with a minimum feature set is a walk on the knife of adroit execution, particularly in consumer markets. The goal is to get the product to market as early as possible to receive customer feedback, but not to distribute the product so widely that its limited feature set becomes etched in the customer’s mind as the finished product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,314
In some cases you may have asked for advisors’ help on an informal basis in Customer Discovery. In this phase, you formally engage them. There are no hard-and-fast rules for how large the advisory board should be. There can be as many people on the board as you want.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,327
Ensure key potential customers are on the “Customer Advisory Board.” These are people you met in Customer Discovery who can advise you about product/market fit from the customer’s perspective.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,344
In Customer Discovery you contacted customers twice, first to understand how they work and the problems they have, and then to present the product and get their reaction to it. Now, in Phase 2 of Customer Validation, the rubber meets the road. Your task is to see whether you truly have product/market fit and can sell early visionary customers before your product is shipping. Why? Your ability to sell your startup’s product will validate whether all your assumptions about your customers and your business model are correct.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,353
The answer is: Giveaways do not prove customers will buy your product. The only valid way to test your assumptions is to sell the product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,360
Therefore, alpha and beta testing are Product Development functions that belong to engineering. They are about validating the product technically, not the market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,364
The reality is that testing an unfinished product for Engineering and testing a customer’s willingness to buy an unfinished product are separate, unrelated functions. Customer Validation is not about having customers pay for products that are engineering tests. It’s about validating the entire market and business model.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,371
Again: The way you validate your business model and whether you truly have product/ market fit is by selling it to customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,379
Use the same techniques you used in Customer Discovery: Generate a customer list, an introductory email, and a reference story/script. Even with all your preparation, assume one out of 20 prospects you call on will engage in the sales process. In other words, be prepared for 95 percent to say no. That’s OK; you only need the other 5 percent. Of those, depending on the economic climate, 1 out of 3 to 1 out of 5 will actually close when you get around to selling. That’s a lot of sales calls.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,426
So far Chip had managed to avoid falling into the trap of early sales: the pressure to customize the product for each of your visionary customers. Your challenge is to sell the product your company will deliver at first customer ship. This means the standard product you have spec’d, not one with lots of special features.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,431
Of course, sometimes these custom feature requests are good news. If enough customers have asked for the same set of “custom” features, then they are not custom at all. The customers have been trying to tell you what the product requirements really are. This is the time to pivot and incorporate those requests into your spec and declare them features.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,461
While you are a startup there is no demand for your product. No one is banging on the door of your partners asking for your product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,463
Until customers become familiar with the brand, they will never look for the product.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,467
Positioning is the attempt to control the public’s perception of a product or service as it relates to competitive products. In Customer Discovery, you began to think about the Market Type you were entering and how your product competed in, redefined or created that market. You could have attempted to formally position the product early, before you made a sale, but you would have been guessing.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,484
Now it is time to put a stake in the ground and formalize your product positioning based on Market Type (see Table 4.4). Your positioning doesn’t have to be perfect, since you will refine it further in Customer Creation.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,494
The end result of this product positioning exercise should be a “product positioning brief.” Similar to the briefs you developed in Customer Discovery, this one-page document should cover the product positioning and its rationale. As you develop sales literature (data sheets, sales presentations, website), this brief will be used to keep all the messages “on point.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,499
Product positioning focuses on the attributes of your specific product in a Market Type. Company positioning answers, “What does your company do for me?” and “Why does your company exist and how is it different?”

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,516
Industry analysts and industry influencers are part of the foundation of credibility a startup needs.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,521
In each industry a handful of people influence what gets talked about. They may be bloggers on Hacker News or they may write for Techcrunch or PandoDaily.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,523
You started identifying analysts and industry influencers in Customer Discovery. The goal in this phase is to meet with them, and get their insights and feedback on the initial positioning (market, product, and company) you have just created and their thoughts about your product features.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,530
First, contact the analysts and influencers you’ve been tracking since early in Customer Discovery. Hopefully, you’ve kept a database of who they are and have met them at conferences, seminars, and trade shows.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,538
Make sure you reference your early customers, and the problem/pain points you solve. When they agree to meet with you, ask how much time you will have, what presentation format they like (formal slides, demo, whiteboard talk, etc.), and whether the presentation should focus on technology, markets, customers, problems, or all of the above.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,547
When you meet with the influencers and analysts, remember the goal is to gather feedback (and wild enthusiasm). You also want to use the interaction to gather intelligence about the marketplace. Make a mental checklist of what is critical for you to learn from them. For example, what other companies are doing anything like what you’re doing? How does your vision fit with market needs? With customer needs? How should you position your product, market, and company? How should you price the product? How do others price theirs? Who in a company should you sell to? What obstacles will you face inside a company? What obstacles will you face as you try to build your company? Getting funded? Hiring? Competition? What do they think you should do next?

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,555
After meeting with analysts and influencers, you have gone all the way around the Customer Validation step. What you have done for the company is discover whether your customer, sales, and channel hypotheses were correct.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,560
At the end of Customer Discovery, you verified that the product as spec’d met hypothetical customer needs, but you hadn’t at that stage asked for an order. Now, at the end of Customer Validation, “verifying the product solution” means showing you have product/market fit with a product customers will buy.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,571
The most important exit criterion is whether the sales closer believes other salespeople can sell the product as spec’d in a repeatable manner.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,574
You have assembled your sales materials, found visionary prospects, combined an organizational map and selling strategy into a sales roadmap, and tried to sell and close customers. In this phase, verifying the sales roadmap means summarizing everything you have learned and checking to see whether you have the selling process nailed or need to go around the loop again.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,583
If you are confident you’ve nailed the sales roadmap, you can proceed. If not, go around the loop again.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,585
Now that you have sold to customers either through an indirect channel or with a direct sales force, you understand how your distribution channel will work.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,600
Having orders in hand, you’re probably feeling like the end is in sight. Your product solves real customer problems, and you believe you have a repeatable and scalable sales and distribution process. However, just as at the end of Customer Discovery, there is the small matter of making money. Now you have real numbers on the most critical variables of your business—how much customers will pay for your product, and how much it will cost you to sell it.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,614
As grueling as Customer Validation is, you may need to iterate it again or even return all the way to Customer Discovery. This is the time to stop what you are doing and be reflective, think seriously about how you are doing. Did you really meet the Customer Validation objectives or are you just moving the goal posts so you can get to the next step? When you go to the next step, you are about to seriously crank up the burn rate of your company. Were you able to sell the product? If not, the problem may be a lack of understanding of the sales process. Take everything you learned in Phases 1 through 3 of Customer Validation, modify your sales roadmap based on customer feedback, and return to Phase 1 of this step (Get Ready to Sell) and try it again.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,630
But if everything checks out, the end of Customer Validation is a major milestone. You have proven you have understood customer problems, found a set of earlyvangelists and delivered a product customers want to buy, developed a repeatable and scalable sales process, and demonstrated you have a profitable business model. And you’ve captured all of your learning in writing. You’re ready for Customer Creation.

In talking to digital camera owners, we found they loved digital cameras for the convenience and immediate gratification, but regretted giving up quality prints. They used the digital camera when they wanted to take photos they could view immediately (or share online), but they still carried their 35 mm camera to capture photos they could turn into lasting memories. If they could get 35 mm prints from their digital camera, it would be the only camera they would use. Until then, it was a two-camera world.

Digital cameras were selling well, the company had raised a pile of money, and beta customers liked the product and were starting to tell their friends about the service.

you’ve followed the line of reasoning of this book to this point, you might guess the answers to these questions. PhotosToYou’s strategy might have made sense in an existing market, but not for a startup in a new market. Not understanding Market Type almost sank PhotosToYou. In fact, once you understand how Market Type affects Customer Creation activities, you’ll understand why the mistakes PhotosToYou made are taught as a case study in my business school class. PhotosToYou did not need a branding strategy. It needed a set of rules to identify its Market Type, and apply the appropriate Customer Creation strategies and tactics.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,692
Since we were creating a new market, I suggested that the PhotosToYou business would take three to five years to develop. For the next two years, their market growth would be limited by outside factors (digital camera and broadband Internet adoption rate) and this was going to be a long-term war, not a short-term grab for nonexistent market share.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,698
PhotosToYou preserve its huge pile of cash and hunker down for the long term. Instead of a huge formal onslaught launch, they should implement an early adopter launch. I also offered that in a new market the first year’s marketing communication goals should be focused on fostering market adoption, not market share, and the company’s demand-creation activities should be low-cost attempts to educate customers about the new online photofinishing market, not hugely expensive customer acquisition programs for the few customers who existed at that time. My belief was in a new market, only the early adopters—the earlyvangelists—will find the product and spread the word.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,738
In Customer Discovery and Validation you began to consider what Market Type your startup is entering. (Existing, Resegmented Low End, Resegmented Niche, or New Market.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,754
The New Lanchester Strategy suggests a few simple rules companies can use to analyze an existing market: If a single company has 74% of the market, the market has become an effective monopoly. For a startup, that’s an unassailable position for a head-on assault. (Think Microsoft.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,756
If the combined market share for the market leader and second-ranking company is greater than 74% and the first company is within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means the market is held by a duopoly. This is also an unassailable position for a startup to attack. (In the telecom sector, Cisco

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,758
If a company has 41% market share and at least 1.7 times the market share of the next largest company, it is the market leader. For a startup, this, too, is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a clear market leader are, for a startup, an opportunity for resegementation.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,760
If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26% market share, the market is unstable, with a strong possibility of abrupt shifts in the company rankings. Here there may be some entry opportunities. If the biggest player has less than 26% market share, it has no real impact in influencing the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market find these the easiest to penetrate.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,763
One more rule in the New Lanchester Strategy is relevant for a startup. If you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing budget of that dominant player. (Ouch, so much for going head-on with Microsoft.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,775
Now that you know the rules, what do they mean for choosing Market Type? Let’s say you are going after a well-defined existing market. If there is a dominant player with more than 74% market share, do not attack that market head-on. Why? Because of the rule that says you need three times the resources of the market leader, you’ll be out of business shortly. Instead, target your attack at the point where your limited resources can make a difference. You will segment the existing market to create a submarket where your product can be unique or substantially different. Or if you can create an entirely new market; you can define a space the market leader does not address.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,781
Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing on the competitors’ weak points until you have a battle you can win. You know your segmentation is correct when you have created a niche where you can be No. 1. Remember, any company can take customers away from any other company—if it can define the battle.

The Art of War: “All warfare is based on deception. If your enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched, fight and if not split and re-evaluate.”

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,789
If there is no single company with more than 26% market share in an existing market, then the startup gods have smiled on you. You can still choose to resegment the market, but the cost of entry is low and the market is ripe for innovation. It is yours to lose.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,796
Creating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption. Given the long-term and deep-pocket commitment necessary in a new market, why not just position the company as one resgementing an existing market? That can be a viable option, but the one piece of great news about creating an entirely new market is once the market is established, as the market leader you are guaranteed at least 41% market share.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,802
Startups creating new markets will not create a market of substantial size to generate a profit until three to seven years from product launch.

Being able to articulate them is the first step in assembling a coherent Customer Creation plan. The four building blocks are: Year one objectives Positioning: both company and product Launch: both company and product Demand creation (advertising, public relations, trade shows, etc.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,836
one of the most egregious mistakes a startup can make is beginning some of the expensive Customer Creation activities (advertising, heavy PR, etc.) too early. A key tenet of the Customer Development philosophy is there should be no serious spending in marketing until the company has a proven and repeatable sales roadmap.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,842
one of the persistent themes from the earliest stages of Customer Development was asking, “What Market Type is our company in?”

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,853
Finally in Customer Creation, the company finalizes its positioning and launches the company and product. All the standard marketing communications activities begin to ramp up. However, the next surprise about this step is that the type of launch is dependent upon the type of startup. There is no “one-size fits all” company or product launch.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,867
Also note the absence of a marketing communications department at this phase of a startup’s life. In fact, there is no marketing department, or sales department. And therefore there is no marketing budget, or sales budget. There is only a Customer Development team and budget. Sure, there are people who write the marketing literature and others who specialize in closing a sale, but they are all working for Customer Development. Only after the company has identified its customers; validated the sales roadmap; and entered, created, or resegmented the market will the organizations within the company begin to differentiate into their traditional roles in Step 4, Company Building.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,887
While a startup will need execution later, Customer Creation strategy should come first. In this phase you do the following: Construct a Market-Type questionnaire Choose the Market Type Agree on the company’s first-year customer creation and sales objectives

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,890
Now that you have collected qualitative and quantitative data about customers and your market, you are ready to choose your Market Type. In gathering this data you have an enviable advantage you did not have before: your early customers. Unlike startups that are trying to figure their Market Type before they have talked to customers, you have had months, if not years, in front of customers in the Customer Discovery and Validation steps.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,900
Understanding your Market Type can help your company avoid the sort of expensive errors PhotosToYou encountered. If PhotosToYou had understood it was in a new market, it would have known no amount of spending to develop branding would create enough customers. Equally important, it would have known its revenue projections were unrealistic.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,904
With the results from the Market-Type Questionnaire, combined with the Market Type analysis outlined in Figure 5.2, you now have sufficient information to pick your Market Type. Picking Market Type is more than just semantics. As we saw earlier in this chapter, all Customer Creation activities need to match the Market Type and startup. Assessing the risks and tradeoffs between each Market Type is first a matter of data collection, then a matter of data analysis, but in the end it is one of judgment. In some startups the choice between positioning as a company resegmenting an existing market or as entering an existing market is a matter of risk, reward, and instinct.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,914
The major risk in entering an existing market is the dominance of the competitors and the consequent cost of entry. Startups should not underestimate the cost of sales and marketing in taking on entrenched competitors. Even the world’s best products need distribution channels and heavy demand-creation spending to become known by potential purchasers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,920
In addition, in an existing market the incumbents have set measures of performance. A startup can attempt to respond by picking the bases of competition (features, price, performance, etc.). Typically these are product features, so the ability of the new company to provide differentiated products is critical.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,925
The risks in a new market are different. You must define the new market in a way that aligns with users’ perceptions of their problem and your solution. Just as important for management and investors, a new market is a long-term investment. New market creation is not about quick returns and instant gratification. For example, Tivo positioned its Digital Video Recorder (DVR) as a new market category. Instead of comparing themselves to a VCR, they decided to create a new category, the DVR, where their products could be priced and differentiated from commodity VCRs. This new market creation takes deep pockets and a long-term vision.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,929
The risks in resegmenting an existing market are a combination of those associated with creating a new market and entering an existing one. The segmentation of the existing market has to be spot-on, and the company must convince existing users their current vendors’ products don’t solve their problems. In addition, the product has to be different enough so existing customers of competitive products can clearly see its unique attributes and benefits. Ikea is a great example of a resegmentation strategy that was both low-cost and targeted a niche. They offer low-cost furniture to customers who want a sense of style. Ikea lowers its costs by eliminating in-store assistance, having a limited variety of furniture (four styles), no delivery, and low-end quality. On the other hand, they delight low-cost buyers with on-site daycare, a great café, innovative housewares and toys, and airy and ultra-modern stores.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,944
In fact, a 1993 paper by Peter N. Golder and Gerard J. Tellis had a much more accurate description of what happens to startup companies entering new markets.5 In their analysis Golder and Tellis found almost half of the market pioneers in their sample of 500 brands in 50 product categories failed. Even worse, the survivors’ mean market share was lower than that found in other studies. Further, their study shows early market leaders (as distinct from first entrants) have much greater long-term success; those in their sample entered the market an average of 13 years later than the pioneers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,956
Therefore, startups whose mantra is “we have to be first to market” usually lose.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,961
Just to make the point that markets are never static, Toyota, a company that sold its first car designed for the U.S. market in 1964, is poised to become the dominant American car company. The issue is not being first to market, but understanding the type of market your company is going to enter.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,968
For an Existing Market If entering an existing market, the year-one objective is to take as much market share as possible from incumbents. Consequently, all Customer Creation activities must single-mindedly focus on demand creation and customer acquisition. To determine how big the opportunity is, use market research data to estimate the size of the total available market. However, a more meaningful number for planning is the size of the serviceable available market. This subset of the total available market is the target market for first-year sales. To calculate the serviceable available market, subtract all the customers who are unreachable in the first year. They may be unreachable because they have already bought a competitive product, because they have product needs broader than your startup’s initial offerings, or because they need a “whole product” (your product plus service, support, and other infrastructure only a mature company can deliver).

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,994
Remember, the objective is market share, which in an existing market is achieved by product differentiation. The Customer Creation goal is to create and drive end-user demand into the sales channel.

Yellow highlight | Location: 2,998
For a New Market If entering a new market, the year-one objective has nothing to do with market share. This idea alone is worth the price of this book. There is no way a new company can get meaningful orders from a market that doesn’t exist. Therefore, spending money on a massive launch to garner customers and market share is ludicrous.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,003
The year-one objective for a company in a new market is to drive or grow adoption of this market. The limited demand-creation activities the company engages in are focused on (1) customer education about the new market and (2) turning earlyvangelists into “reference customers” for the emerging market to emulate. The success criterion for year one is that the number of potential customers has gone from zero to meaningful.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,007
For Resegmenting a Market If resegmenting an existing market, the year-one objective is doubly difficult. Not only do you have to garner as much market share as possible, but you must educate customers about the new issues in the market. The Customer Creation activities must create demand and acquire customers while segmenting the market in a way that is meaningful to customers. In entering a market you are resegmenting, the budget process is the same as for entering an existing market. As in an existing market, test your budget number against the New Lanchester Strategy; while the rules are the same, if you’ve segmented the market correctly, the number of your competitors should be significantly reduced.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,019
Remember, the goal of positioning is to control the public’s perception of a product or service as it relates to competitors’ alternatives. The company and product positioning you develop in this phase becomes the touchstone for communications, marketing, and relationships.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,039
Finally, make sure your agency understands and buys into the notion of Market Type. If the people at the agency resolutely believe that all startups are launched the same way, hiring them will be an expensive mistake. The good news is that most sophisticated agencies know there are different Market Types—they just have never used the terminology before.

While conducting an audit is the kind of activity PR agencies excel at, handing this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as your early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your early audits are too important to be handed off to a PR agency. The founding team should make the first five or so calls.

Company positioning answers, “What does your company do for me?” A great company positioning begins and ends with the customer in mind. If potential customers heard your company positioning statement, would they care? Would they get excited and want to feel connected with the company? For example Apple Computer positions itself as a manufacturer of “cool computers,” appealing to trend-setting customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,067
For an Existing Market If you are entering an existing market, then company positioning is about creating the notion that your company is both different and credible. When Handspring entered the personal digital assistant market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer of Palm-like devices but they were going to be expandable, faster, cheaper, and somehow better. Handspring also had immediate credibility since the founders were the creators of the Palm and the entire PDA market. Once the positioning for the company is chosen, product positioning follows. Since in an existing market comparable products exist, product positioning typically describes how and why your product is different along an existing axis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one of three forms. You can describe differences in product attributes (faster, cheaper, less filling, 30% more), in distribution channel (pizza in 30 minutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the Web), or in service (five-year, 50,000-mile warranty; 90-day money-back guarantee; lifetime warranty). For example, Handspring differentiated on product attributes. It said that all Handspring PDAs were different and better because they were “expandable with a Springboard expansion module, and had 16 versus 8 megabytes of memory.” Because the market already existed, and customers understood the basis of competition, existing PDA customers understood what Handspring was talking about. The result was 30% of the Palm-compatible market in 15 months.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,079
For a New Market If you are creating a new market, company positioning cannot be about how different your company is, since there are no other companies to compare it to. Positioning here is about communicating a vision and passion of what could be. It answers the questions, “What is wrong with the world that you want to make right? What is it that your company is trying to change?” When Palm created the first personal digital assistant, the company positioning was about communicating a vision of how having a PDA was going to make life easier for consumers. As another example, PhotosToYou’s passionate positioning should have been “allowing consumers to make hassle-free photo prints from your digital camera.” That was a vision a digital camera customer could understand and connect with. Instead, PhotosToYou described itself as “the best online photofinisher.” While technically correct, that message assumed potential customers understood what an online photofinisher was. When the market does not yet exist, customers need to first understand what problem your company is solving. After positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market becomes pretty simple. Touting a new product’s features is unproductive, since there is no context to understand the features—no comparable products exist. For example, if Palm had positioned its first PDA product as having 16 megabytes of memory and being expandable, no one would have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead Palm’s product positioning talked about the problem the product solved (“Now executives can keep in sync with their computers”) and how the product solved it (“A PDA allows you to put all those functions in your pocket”).

For Resegmenting a Market If you are resegmenting an existing market, then company positioning depends on segmentation of the market, not differentiation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct spot in customers’ minds that is unique, understandable, and, most importantly, concerns something they value, and want and need now. Company positioning for this Market Type communicates the value of the market segment you’ve chosen and the innovation your company brings to it. There are two types of market resegmentation: as a segmented niche or as a low-cost provider. Jet Blue is an example of low-cost resegmentation. Unlike Southwest Airlines, an example of low-cost resegmentation which offered cheap fares, matched by minimal frills, Jet Blue entered the airline business as a low-cost passenger airline that provides high-quality customer service on point-to-point routes. To contain costs, Jet Blue focused on underserved markets and large metropolitan areas that have high average fares. The rise of Wal-Mart was an example of an entrepreneur recognizing an existing market was ripe for a niche resegmentation. In the 1960s and ’70s, Sears and Kmart dominated big box discount retailing, opening large stores where they thought there was sufficient population to sustain them. Smaller communities either got catalog stores (Sears) or were simply ignored (Kmart). Sam Walton realized towns being dismissed as “too small” were an opportunity for a large discount retailer. “Small towns first” was the unique niche resegmentation Wal-Mart initially took. Once established, it proudly positioned itself as a “discounter”—a sobriquet the large retailers avoided like the plague. Wal-Mart sold name-brand health and beauty aids at cost. This strategy, supported by heavy advertising, pulled in customers who then purchased other products that, while priced low, carried high gross margins. Equally important, Wal-Mart’s adoption of cutting-edge technology to track how people shop, and to buy and deliver goods more efficiently and cheaply than any rival, allowed it to reduce its cost of sales to a fraction of its competitors’. By 2002 Kmart was bankrupt and Wal-Mart was the largest company in the world. When resegmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of positioning for a new market and positioning for an existing one. Since your segmentation has moved your product into a space adjacent to your competitors, product positioning describes how and why your new market segment is different and important to your customers.

The company needs to select and commit to a launch strategy matching its Market Type.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,124
There are three types of launches: onslaught, niche, and early adopter. Let’s look at what is unique about each type.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,125
For an Existing Market: Onslaught Launch An onslaught launch is a full-frontal assault on a market using every available demand-creation tool. Most startups select this launch approach. However, it is the correct launch model for only one type of strategy: capturing market share in an existing market. Onslaught is an expensive, high-commitment move characterized by maximum exposure at a single point in time. This type of launch is heavily weighted to up-front expenditures on advertising, public relations, trade shows, direct mail, and so on. The New Lanchester Strategy rules to determine the cost of market entry apply to this type of launch, but ironically, the bigger and more diverse your competitor, the better your odds. Why? Because in facing a diversified company, you are not facing the full brunt of your competitor’s sales and marketing might. Its spending is spread over multiple divisions, multiple products, and multiple distribution channels. For example, suppose you decided to enter the computer mouse business. Microsoft is the dominant player, and according to our rules, you would need at least 1.7 times Microsoft’s sales and marketing budget to enter this market (refer to Table 5.2). How on earth could you ever get that? At first glance, this looks hopeless. But on closer inspection, it may be doable. Competing with a company with multiple divisions and product lines means you can focus all your resources (read: every dollar you have) to compete with the division or product line that directly opposes your product, not the entire company. Therefore, again using Microsoft as the example, your cost of entering this market is now 1.7 times the spending of the Microsoft peripheral division. While still a formidable number (and perhaps still enough to scare you away), it allows you to calculate the true cost of entry. Obviously we’re only talking about market entry, not long-term competition. Kick a large company in the shins long and hard enough, and you will get its attention. (Ask Netscape what happened when it belittled Microsoft one too many times in the business press. Sometimes big, sleeping giants can awaken.) By the time your competitor turns its full marketing and sales prowess on to your company, you’d better have turned your early market advantage into defensible market share by using the chasm-crossing strategies in the Company Building step.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,143
For a New Market: Early Adopter Launch In contrast to onslaught and niche launches, the early adopter launch is a targeted, low-cost approach. The goal here is to prepare a new market for the day it will become a mass market. Since the target market does not support enough customers to justify spending to gain market share, the aim is to gain maximum mind share. The good news is by their very nature, early adopters tend to ignore expensive mass-market advertising and PR events. Instead, they rely on other media such as the Internet, focus groups, and word of mouth. An early adopter launch is the beginning of a long, drawn-out education campaign initially targeted to earlyvangelists. It uses the passion and enthusiasm of these earlyvangelists to diffuse a new idea into the collective consciousness of potential customers and thereby to create a market. Put another way, the goal is to create a “tipping point” in customer demand. (The best description of these “tipping point” strategies is in Malcolm Gladwell’s book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference.6) This is the antithesis of the onslaught launch. New markets are not created overnight; it can take three to seven years from product launch for a new market to reach sufficient size for most startups to become profitable. During the dot-com bubble, venture capitalists and PR agencies advocated the onslaught launch for companies entering new markets. They preached startups were all about first-mover advantage. An onslaught launch would persuade competitors to withdraw, or allow the startup to consolidate a fragmented industry, or at least deter competitors from expanding their presence. The reality was much different. At PhotosToYou, for example, a cascading series of wrong assumptions had the company executing an onslaught launch for a new market. As they discovered, an onslaught launch in a new market with few customers is a huge expenditure of money with very little return. PhotosToYou survived, but most startups in new markets that used an onslaught launch are out of business.

For Resegmenting a Market: Niche Launch If you are trying to resegment an existing market, the launch choices are a lot harder. New Lanchester Strategy rules still apply, but by segmenting the market, you’ve diluted the power of your competitors’ sales and marketing budgets since you are now in an adjacent market. The relevant question is: “Are there customers ready to buy in the segment we’ve defined?” If so, proceed with an all-out launch to capture market share (as in an onslaught launch), but target the launch to the customers in your new niche. In a niche launch, the company puts all its demand-creation dollars into acquiring a single identifiable market segment and customer. However, if the new segment you are defining is speculative—that is, you are creating the market segment and its customers—then treat this market as you would a new market and execute an early adopter launch.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,170
One pitfall startups often fall into is selecting an audience with whom they are comfortable and familiar, rather than the one most likely to buy their product. The Customer Development process should help you avoid looking in the wrong place for your audience.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,179
To define the audience for the launch, select the people on the influence map your launch messages need to reach. However, beware of another trap startups fall into: thinking everyone on the influence map is a target for the launch messages. Everyone can’t be in the audience, or the message will get diluted. To be successful the audience must be a small group (or even an individual) that carries the most influence. More specifically: In an existing market the launch audience is the user or organization responsible for choosing (not necessarily using) the product In a new market, the launch audience consists of potential earlyvangelists who recognize they have a problem and have been actively looking for a solution In a resegmented market, the launch audience is made up of users or organizations that will appreciate the segment you’ve selected

There are three types of messengers your company needs to educate: Experts, evangelists, and connectors.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,199
Experts are exactly what they sound like. They know your industry or product in detail, and others rely on them for their opinions. Experts may be industry analysts in private research firms (Gartner, NPD, AMR), Wall Street analysts (Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs), or consultants who provide advice for your particular industry.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,209
The second classes of messengers, evangelists, are unabashed cheerleaders and salespeople for your product and, if yours is a new or resegmented market, for your Market Type. They tell everyone how great the product is and about the unlimited potential of your product and market. While nominally carrying less credibility than experts, evangelists have two advantages: typically they are paying customers, and they are incredibly enthusiastic about what they have to say.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,217
Connectors are a sometimes unrecognized type of messenger. They are not product or industry experts, nor have they bought anything from your company. They are individuals who seem to know everyone; each industry has a few. They may be bloggers who expound on the general state of your industry and write magazine or newspaper columns. They may be individuals who organize and hold conferences where the key industry thought leaders gather.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,224
Great public relations firms know how to influence the messengers. They may have their own language describing who the messengers are (e.g., “influencers”) and how they manage the “information chain,” but a competent PR firm can add tremendous value at this step.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,228
Here I want to add just one more thought as you craft the final messages: messages need to be memorable and “sticky.” Why? Because the more memorable or sticky a message, the greater its ability to create change. And in the case of a company and product launch, not only do we want people to change their buying behavior; we want them to change how they think.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,242
Envisage the state had announced it was spraying “Spring Mist” or “Summer Dew,” or even “Bugs Away,” every evening rather than “Malathion.” The subtle alteration in the message would have had a dramatic impact. People would have been standing outside soaking up the spray rather than sealing their windows with plastic. You may laugh, thinking no one would change his or her perceptions based on semantics, but in fact people do every day. Think about a hamburger. You may eat a lot of them, but if McDonald’s message was “dead cow, slaughtered by the millions, butchered by minimum wage-earners, sometimes contaminated with E. coli, then ground into patties, frozen into solid blocks, and reheated when you order them,” instead of “You deserve a break today,” sales might be a tad lower.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,253
For a company entering an existing market or attempting to resegment one, the messages are about, “There’s got to be a better way, and our company has it.” The messages answer the questions you posed when you talked to earlyvangelists: “What pain does this alleviate? What value does it deliver? And why should I care?”

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,257
A message that is brilliant today and gets customers begging to buy your product could have fallen flat two years ago and may be obsolete in three years. Why? Because “no message is an island.” In crafting your messages, remember that all messages operate in a context. (Another idea from The Tipping Point.) They don’t just show up in a potential customer’s ear by themselves. Messages are accompanied by lots of other messages that can radically increase (or decrease) how memorable or sticky your message is. Satellite TV (DirecTV, EchoStar) messages caught on when cable companies’ service became abysmal and pricing went through the roof. U.S. corporations paid a lot more attention to the security of their infrastructure after 9/11.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,267
Today, those messages wouldn’t get a phone call returned, and people would feel embarrassed if they repeated them. The messages in this new context were not only ineffective, they were toxic to anyone who passed them on. Ponder this for a minute: it’s the same message, same company, but a new context.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,276
In fact, for most startups in the business-to-business space the use of paid media is overkill at launch. Your company needs to formulate a media strategy—a plan that describes what media will be used to reach your customers and, more importantly, which media won’t. Rather than picking the cheapest media on the basis of readership, remember your hard work in the Customer Discovery and Customer Validation steps has already told you a lot about what media your early customers rely on. If you forgot to ask them, now is a good time to go back and iterate. The checklist in Table 5.7 will help formulate your questions.

For companies entering an existing market, the function of demand creation is to create qualified end-user demand and drive it into the sales channel For companies resegmenting a market, the function of demand creation is to educate customers about the new benefits resegmenting the market has created and drive demand into the sales channel For companies entering a new market, the function of demand creation is to educate customers about the market and drive the early or niche adopters into the sales channel. (See Table 5.9)

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,362
However, in some cases there may be nothing wrong with your positioning, messages, or demand-creation activities. The problem may be in the Market Type. If you are getting creamed by competitors, or if you cannot generate demand, it’s time to step back and ask, “Are we in the right Market Type?”

She said Mark thrived on chaos and managed well in it. The problem was BetaSheet needed to become a company that moved beyond chaos. It was getting bigger, and since the span of control was beyond Mark’s reach, it needed process and procedures. Yet Mark had derisively rejected all of her proposals on how to put processes in place to manage the size the company would become. “We have a dysfunctional company. The exec staff is now split between people who have given up thinking for themselves and just do what Mark tells them to do, and those who still can think for themselves and are going to leave. The company has grown past Mark, and the board needs to make a choice.” I left the restaurant hearing a stark call to action.

just look at Bill Gates at Microsoft or Larry Ellison at Oracle. They each had people around them to manage the things they weren’t great at.

Once again, Market Type is key. Just as this fundamental strategic choice shaped your choices in finding and reaching earlyvangelists, it will now shape how your company will grow and how you will allocate resources to do this. That’s because each of the four Market Types has a distinctive sales growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in transitioning sales from the earlyvangelists to mainstream customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,503
Most entrepreneurs whose companies have reached this stage breathe a sigh of relief, thinking their journey is over and the hard work is behind them. They have found their customers and created a repeatable sales roadmap. Now all they need to do is hire additional sales staff. This common wisdom is incorrect. The most dangerous trap is a lack of understanding about Market Types. Market Type predicts not only how this transition will occur but also the type of staffing, hiring, and spending you will need. Moore’s insight is that early adopters (earlyvangelists, in our lingo) are not high-volume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales does not provide the sales roadmap for later mainstream buyers. Moore posits that a company must come up with new sales strategies in order to bridge the chasm. (See Figure 6.2.)

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,511
Customer Development is on the left-hand side of the adoption curve. The chasm is the gap in sales revenue that occurs when sales to earlyvangelists do not smoothly transition into mainstream sales. The width of the gap varies dramatically with the Market Type, which explains the different sales growth curves for each Market Type.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,570
You want to achieve a management system and departments that communicate and delegate strategic objectives to the staff so they can operate without direct daily control while still pursuing the same mission. This can be achieved only if executives are selected because they share the same values, not just because their resumes show lots of experience.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,590
Process is essential for setting measurable goals and establishing repeatable procedures that do not require experts to implement. Process is how large companies can grow larger, how they can scale departments and the company without hiring superstars. Large companies can hire thousands of average employees who can follow the rules and check to see whether the business is proceeding according to plan. Process in an organization means procedures, rules, measurements, goals and stability.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,607
Finally, in Phase 4, at the end of Customer Development, the company works to create fast-response departments for scale, speed, and agility. Here you use the military concept of OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) by moving and responding to competitors and customers at a tempo much faster than your competition. This requires departments to have at their fingertips up-to-date customer information and to be able to rapidly disseminate that information across the company.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,631
Further, pragmatists do not care for or trust the visionaries as references. Pragmatists want references from other pragmatists. The chasm between earlyvangelists and volume sales to mainstream customers occurs because these two groups of customers have little in common. In a new market, the gap between visionary enthusiasm and mainstream acceptance is at its widest point (see Figure 6.5). The width of the gap explains the hockey-stick sales growth curve often seen in a new market: a small blip of revenue in the first year or so from sales to earlyvangelists and then a long, flat period, or even a dip, until the sales force learns how to sell to a completely different class of customers and Marketing convinces pragmatists your new product is worth adopting.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,642
The risk on the other side of the chasm is that you may never get there. Mainstream pragmatists in a new market may see no reason to start adopting your product. Especially in tough economic times, few customers want to be innovators if they can help it.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,696
In an existing market, the chasm between earlyvangelists and mainstream customers is small or may not exist (see Figure 6.7). That’s because the visionaries and pragmatists are the same type of customer. In an established market, all customers will readily understand your product and its benefits.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,699
The only limits on sales growth are market share and differentiation. The absence of a chasm is a signal that this market is ripe for exploitation and relentless execution. The challenge is while customers may understand your product and benefits, they may not understand why they should buy your product rather than one from a familiar existing company.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,704
This is where positioning9 and branding 10 come into play. Positioning and branding are well-known strategies for differentiating companies and products. At times these two words are used synonymously, which is a problem since they are different, and the difference matters.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,708
the fastest and least expensive way to differentiate your company and product is to establish positioning, or value (i.e., everyone knows why your product is better and wants it) rather than pursuing branding (everyone knows about your product and thinks your company is wonderful).

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,730
A resegmented market strategy lands your company somewhere between a new market and an existing market. Although the chasm between earlyvangelists and mainstream customers is not as wide as in a new market (Figure 6.9), it takes time to convince mainstream customers that what you have defined as unique about your product or company is a compelling selling proposition. As a result, in the early years, sales may be low.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,738
Crossing the chasm in this Market Type means attracting masses of mainstream customers who need to be educated to what’s new and different about the way you’ve redefined the market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,740
However, instead of using niche marketing and tipping point strategies as you would in a new market, you use branding and positioning to reach mainstream customers. It is here, in a resegmented market, that all the conventional wisdom about branding and positioning is actually valid. Marketers use these tactical tools to differentiate their company and product from those in an existing market. For example, in the home appliance market, Subzero, Miele and Bosch created a new segment of kitchen appliances: high-end and featureladen. Consumers (at least in the U.S.) were perplexed about why they should pay exorbitant prices for what were “just” refrigerators, washers, and dryers. However, after some time, adroit marketing and positioning took hold, and these previously mundane appliances turned into status symbols. Similar examples of successful resegementation can be found across a wide variety of industries: Starbucks transforming the 49-cent cup of coffee into the $3 latte; Dell turning commodity personal computers into build-your-own, custom-designed products; Perrier and Calistoga turning water, the ultimate commodity, into a high-end purchase that costs more than gas.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,749
resegmenting an existing market typically is expensive, and companies require sufficient capital for seeing an adroit marketing and positioning through to completion.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,756
The key in a market you are resegmenting is to use positioning to establish the value of the new segment and create demand for a product. Then you can use branding to reinforce the value of that segment and grow demand exponentially into the hockey-stick part of the sales curve.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,762
Sales growth in a resegmented market is a complicated balancing act, since it combines the sales growth models of new and existing markets. The good news is there is an existing market of customers who will readily understand what the product is. This allows the company to immediately generate some level of sales even amid stiff competition.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,785
To get here, the company needed people like Mark at BetaSheet: passionate visionaries capable of articulating a compelling vision, agile enough to learn and discover as they went, resilient enough to deal with countless failures, and responsive enough to capitalize on what they learned in order to get early customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,800
As the company grows, however, it needs less of an iconoclastic superstar and more of a leader who is mission- and goal-driven. Leaders at this stage must be comfortable driving the company goals down the organization, and building and encouraging mission-oriented leadership on the departmental level.

Founders are too individualistic and cantankerous, and the company would be much easier to run and calmer without them.” All this is often true — particularly in a company in an existing market, where the gap between early customers and the mainstream market is nonexistent, and execution and process are paramount. A founding CEO who wants to chase new markets rather than reap the rewards of the existing one is the bane of investors, and an unwitting candidate for unemployment.

The new executives Mark hired to run Sales, Marketing, and Engineering acted like hired guns rather than committed owners. Part of this was Mark’s fault in not selecting his hires for commitment to his vision rather than the length of their resume.

The goal of the earlier mission statements was to help customers understand how your company and products are unique.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,871
First, the corporate mission statement you develop now is for use inside the company. You may use some version of it to make your customers and investors happy, but that is not its purpose. Second, the mission statement is action-oriented. It is written to provide daily guidance for all employees. For that reason, it is focused on execution and what the company is trying to achieve.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,881
Figure 6.11 shows a rough template for drafting a corporate mission statement based on the one for CafePress. As you write (and rewrite) your mission statement, remember there are no right and wrong answers. The litmus test is this: Can new hires read the corporate mission statement and understand the company, their job, and what they need to do to succeed?

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,883
Keep in mind a mission statement for a company executing in an existing market will be quite different from a company in a new or resegmented market. In an existing market, the mission statement reflects the goal of straight-line sales growth. It describes how the company executes relentlessly to exploit the market while remaining paranoid about product lifecycle and competitors. In a new market, the company mission statement reflects the hockey-stick growth curve, and it emphasizes husbanding resources and passionately evangelizing and growing the market. In a resegmented market the mission statement describes the branding and positioning work necessary to create a unique and differentiated image of the company.

Unfortunately, a Customer Development team without functional organization cannot scale. To remedy this, the company now needs to organize into departments that aggregate specific business functions that would have been counterproductive in earlier stages—principally sales, marketing, and business development—and organize them appropriately to match the needs of the company’s Market Type.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,933
Department Roles in an Existing Market Until now, the role of Sales as part of the Customer Development team has been to confirm product/market fit, find repeatable sales and channel roadmaps, and secure the earlyvangelist customers and orders to prove the roadmaps and business model work. Now that you have a critical mass of early customers, the role of a sales department is, “Get more of those customers to scale revenue and the company.” That’s because only in an existing market are the earlyvangelists and mainstream customers quite similar. Therefore you need to build a sales organization that can repeatedly and reliably execute from a known roadmap. This implies a sales compensation program that will incentivize the correct behavior—no wild swings for the fence, no new market forays, just day-to-day, relentless execution.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,955
The real function of a business development group is to assemble the strategic relationships necessary to build the “whole product” via partnerships and deals so the company can sell to mainstream customers.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,957
The “whole product” is a concept defined by Bill Davidow11 in the early years of technology marketing. It says that mainstream customers and late adopters on the technology lifecycle adoption curve need an off-the-shelf, no-risk, complete solution. They do not want to assemble piece parts from startups. In an existing market, your competitors define how complete your product offering needs to be. If your competitors have “whole products,” you need the same.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,964
No mainstream customer, however, is going to buy a half-finished product. Consequently, the strategic mission of Business Development is to assemble a whole product to acquire mainstream customers. This means Business Development is a partnering and deal function, not a sales activity.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,977
The job of Marketing in a new market is to identify the potential mainstream customers, understand how they differ from the earlyvangelists, and come up with a chasm-crossing strategy to reach them. The danger here is that Marketing will act as if it is in an existing market and begin heavy demand-creation spending or worse, believe it can accelerate customer adoption by “branding.” In a new market, there is no demand to create.

Department Roles in a Resegmented Market A resegmented market requires strategies and departmental missions that combine the features of departments in existing and new markets. For this reason, departments in this type of company can sometimes feel and act schizophrenic. You start competing in an existing market where competition is fierce, with the goal of uniquely differentiating the product into a space where no one currently resides, but where you hope lots of customers will follow.

Yellow highlight | Location: 3,994
The sales department in a resegmented market follows two tracks: selling to customers in an existing and very competitive environment (with a product that has fewer features than the competition) while simultaneously attempting to find new customers, as if in a new market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 4,006
As described in Phase 1 of this chapter, branding and positioning are the appropriate marketing tools for differentiation. Similarly, Business Development needs to find the unique partnerships and relationships that constitute the “whole product,” required to differentiate the company from other vendors. Table 6.5 summarizes department roles in a resegmented market.

Yellow highlight | Location: 4,013
In business, no less than in war, fast decision-making has lethal consequences for the laggards. To sell to mainstream customers and build long-term success for your company, you need to create an agile organization that can respond to customers, competitors, and market opportunities as rapidly as possible.

Yellow highlight | Location: 4,026
Speed in management means shortening the time needed to make decisions, plan, coordinate, and communicate, and the time to incorporate feedback. In an existing market, it is speed relative to the competition and customers. In a new or resegmented market, it is speed relative to your cash flow and profitability. The aim is to be faster than your competitors (or faster than your cash-burn rate) and react quickly to customer needs or opportunities.

Mission-centric management is the foundation on which agile companies like Sun build fast-response departments. Unlike relatively inflexible, process-driven management, mission-centric management deals better with the two fundamental problems a startup continually faces: uncertainty and time.

Mission-centric management tactics support decentralized decision-making. Once in position, this type of decision-making results in an agile, sped-up, and informed decision-making process that makes a company flexible, cohesive, and responsive—in other words, a growing company that kicks butt.

Think of intention as the answer to the aphorism, “When you are up to your neck in alligators it’s hard to remember you were supposed to drain the swamp.”

The higher an executive sits in the corporate hierarchy, the more general should be the supervision he or she exercises, and the less the burden of detail. The CEO and VPs should intervene in a subordinate’s actions only in exceptional cases when irreparable harm is imminent.

Unfortunately, BetaSheet’s unique, new market was immediately crowded with competitors who could see the opportunity BetaSheet had pioneered. And the employees who could have saved the company with innovative and creative product and market ideas had long since left.

Creating a culture of employee initiative depends on selecting, hiring, and retaining employees who work best in this type of environment. You do not have the basis for fast-response departments if you hire (or tolerate) employees or executives who wait for orders, believe they must do everything by the book, learn never to tell the boss anything that will make him or her uncomfortable, or are used to being superstars who never have to cooperate with their peers. At this stage of your company’s life, your competitors or your own inertia will soon put you out of business.

Mutual trust and communication simply cannot exist in an environment where an admission of failure or a request for help is looked down upon as a career-limiting move, or where information is hoarded as a source of power. For cooperation to be maintained, the company must establish a culture of quickly removing employees or executives who do not earn the respect and trust of their peers.

In order to earn executives’ trust, employees must demonstrate the self-discipline to accomplish their missions with minimal supervision and to always act in accordance with the mission intention. Executives and managers, in order to earn employees’ trust, must demonstrate they will support and protect employees as they exercise initiative.

“Good Enough” Decision-Making Gen. George Patton said, “A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.” The same is true in your company. Most decisions in a small company must be made in the face of uncertainty. Since every situation is unique, there is no perfect solution to any customer or competitor problem, and you shouldn’t agonize over trying to find one. This doesn’t mean gambling the company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable degree of risk, and doing it quickly. In general, the company that consistently makes and implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often decisive, competitive advantage.

The result should be a “Good Enough” decision-making culture.

First-hand knowledge is the “getting down and dirty outside the building” method you’ve used until now. Executives need to continue this activity even while the company grows. They need to hear what customers are saying, what competitors are doing, and what the sales staff is experiencing. From this view, executives can get a sense of what they can and cannot demand of their people in the field.

The second picture is a synthesized “bird’s-eye view” of the customer and competitive environment. You assemble this view by gathering information from a variety of sources: sales data, win/loss information, market research data, competitive analyses, and so on. From this big-picture view, executives try to make sense of the shape of the market and the overall patterns in the unfolding competitive and customer situation.

The third view is of the action as seen through the eyes of customers and competitors. Put yourself in your customers’ and competitors’ shoes in order to deduce possible competitors’ moves and anticipate customer needs. In an existing market this is where you ask yourself, “If I were my own competitor and had its resources, what would my next move be?” In looking through the eyes of a customer, the question might be, “Why should I buy from this company versus another one? What do I see that will convince me to give them an order?” In a new or resegmented market, the questions might be, “Why would more than a few techno junkies buy this product? How would I get my 90-year-old grandmother to understand and buy this product? How would I explain it to her and her friends?”

One way to keep and motivate superstars is to integrate them into larger teams as role models and coaches. If they can teach, make them coaches. If they prefer isolation, let them be revered role models. And if they are outspoken, they can become the voices in the wilderness that will sometimes be prophetic—as long as your culture protects the mavericks.

Iterate and Grow The end of this company-building phase brings to mind a quote from Winston Churchill in World War II after the British finally won their first major land victory over the Germans at el Alamein in North Africa: “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”14 The same can now certainly be said for you and your company—it is the end of the beginning.

The payoff for successfully executing this company-building step is a set of words that any founder or CEO would be proud to hear: a profitable, successful, relentless, driven, and tenacious company with satisfied employees on the path to an IPO.
