Bad customer conversations aren’t just useless. Worse, they convince you that you’re on the right path. They give you a false positive which causes you to over-invest your cash, your time, and your team.Read more at location 61   

But I learned that there’s a big gap between textbooks and check books.Read more at location 76   

The Mom Test is a set of simple rules for crafting good questions that even your mom can't lie to you about.Read more at location 101   

Our misguided entrepreneur has a few more conversations like this, becomes increasingly convinced he’s right, quits his job, and sinks his savings into the app. Then he wonders why nobody (even his mom) buys the app, especially since he had been so rigorous.Read more at location 129   

The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers' lives and world views.Read more at location 175   

Until we get specific, it always seems like a good idea.Read more at location 179   

The second gave us actionable insight. Why? What was different about the second conversation? Mom was unable to lie to us because we never talked about our idea.Read more at location 188   

That’s kind of weird, right? We find out if people care about what we’re doing by never mentioning it. Instead, we talk about them and their lives.Read more at location 190   

However, the big mistake is almost always to mention your idea too soon rather than too late.  If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to your customer conversations.Read more at location 192   

Here are 3 simple rules to help you. They are collectively called (drumroll) The Mom Test: The Mom Test: Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more It’s called The Mom Test because it leads to questions that even your mom can’t lie to you about. When you do it right, they won’t even know you have an idea.Read more at location 195   

Rule of thumb: Customer conversations are bad by default. It’s your job to fix them.Read more at location 201   

"Do you think it's a good idea?" Awful question! Here’s the thing: only the market can tell if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. Unless you’re talking to a deep industry expert, this is self-indulgent noise with a high risk of false positives.Read more at location 213   

Rule of thumb: Opinions are worthless.Read more at location 220   

"Would you buy a product which did X?" Bad question. You’re asking for opinions and hypotheticals from overly optimistic people who want to make you happy. The answer to a question like this is almost always “yes”, which makes it worthless.Read more at location 221   

Rule of thumb: Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie.Read more at location 227   

Rule of thumb: People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear.Read more at location 232   

"What would your dream product do?" Sort-of-okay question, but only if you ask good follow-ups.Read more at location 233   

Rule of thumb: People know what their problems are, but they don’t know how to solve those problems.Read more at location 238   

"Why do you bother?" Good question. I love this sort of question. It’s great for getting from the perceived problem to the real one.Read more at location 240   

A question like “why do you bother” points toward their motivations. It gives you the why.  Rule of thumb: You're shooting blind until you understand their goals.Read more at location 244   

"What are the implications of that?" Good question. This distinguishes between I-will-pay-to-solve-that problems and thats-kind-of-annoying-but-I-can-deal-with-it “problems”. Some problems have big, costly implications. Others exist but don’t actually matter.Read more at location 247   

Rule of thumb: Some problems don’t actually matter.Read more at location 253   

"Talk me through the last time that happened." Good question. Your high school writing teacher may have told you that good stories are meant to “show, not tell”. Whenever possible, you want to be shown, not told by your customers. Learn through their actions instead of their opinions.Read more at location 254   

Rule of thumb: Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are.Read more at location 264   

"What else have you tried?" Good question. What are they using now? How much does it cost and what do they love and hate about it? How much would those fixes be worth and how big of a pain would it be for them to switch to a new solution?Read more at location 266   

the abstract, it’s something he would “definitely” pay to solve. Once we got specific, he didn't even care enough to search for a solutionRead more at location 275   

Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours.Read more at location 280   

"Would you pay X for a product which did Y?" Bad question. The fact that you’ve added a number doesn’t help. This is bad for the same reasons as the others: people are overly optimistic about what they would do and want to make you happy. Plus, it’s about your idea instead of their life.Read more at location 281   

Another way to fix it, if you’re far enough along, is to literally ask for money. If you have the deposit or pre-order in hand, you know they were telling the truth.Read more at location 287   

"How are you dealing with it now?" Good question. Beyond workflow information, this gives you a price anchor. If they’re paying £100/month for a duct-tape workaround, you know which ballpark you're playingRead more at location 288   

Do you want to be a replacement for the web app at a yearly value of £1.2k or for the agency at 100x that?Read more at location 293   

Rule of thumb: While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them.Read more at location 294   

"Where does the money come from?" Good question. This isn't something you would necessarily ask a consumer (though you might), but in a B2B context it’s a must-ask. It leads to a conversation about whose budget the purchase will come from and who else within their company holds the power to torpedo the deal.Read more at location 295   

"Who else should I talk to?" Good question. Yes! End every conversation like this. Lining up the first few conversations can be challenging, but if you’re onto something interesting and treating people well, your leads will quickly multiply via intros.Read more at location 301   

"Is there anything else I should have asked?" Good question. Usually, by the end of the meeting, people understand what you’re trying to do.Read more at location 306   

You’ll notice that none of the good questions were about asking what you should build. One of the recurring “criticisms” about talking to customers is that you’re abdicating your creative vision and building your product by committee. Given that people don’t know what they want, that wouldn’t be a terribly effective approach. Deciding what to build is your job.Read more at location 313   

It boils down to this: you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution.Read more at location 319   

With the exception of industry experts who have built very similar businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not compliments.Read more at location 341   

The best way to escape the misinformation of compliments is to avoid them completely by not mentioning your idea.Read more at location 343   

you don’t need to end up with what you wanted to hear in order to have a good conversation. You just need to get to the truth.Read more at location 389   

Them: “Oh, it’s really not that big of a deal for us. We kind of just ignore it.” The implications of the problem are non-existent so I’m not in the market for a solution.Read more at location 395   

Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and entirely worthless.Read more at location 410   

When someone starts talking about what they “always” or “usually” or “never” or “would” do, they are giving you generic and hypothetical fluff. Follow The Mom Test and bring them back to specifics in the past. Ask when it last happened, for them to talk you through it, how they solved it, and what else they tried.Read more at location 415   

The world’s most deadly fluff is: “I would definitely buy that.”Read more at location 417   

The first startup I worked at fell for the “I would definitely buy that” trap and subsequently lost about 10 million bucks.Read more at location 421   

While using generics, people describe themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to get specific to bring out the edge cases.Read more at location 455   

Startups are about focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping on every good one which crosses your desk.Read more at location 508   

They had asked for analytics. We had jumped to the conclusion that they wanted to better understand their data. But they had really wanted a way to keep their own clients happy. If we had properly understood that, we would have built a totally different (and much simpler) set of features.Read more at location 546   

Consider how much easier our lives would have been if we’d understood the motivation behind the request.Read more at location 548   

When you hear a request, it’s your job to understand the motivations which led to it. You do that by digging around the question to find the root cause. Why do they bother doing it this way? Why do they want the feature? How are they currently coping without the feature? Dig.Read more at location 553   

The founder mentioned a problem and the guy responded, “Yeah, that’s pretty much the worst part of my day.” The founder jotted something down in his notebook, and then moved on to the next question. What!? It’s the worst part of his day and you’re not going to figure out why? That’s insane.Read more at location 558   

Rule of thumb: Ideas and feature requests should be understood, but not obeyed.Read more at location 569   

Some famous entrepreneurs don’t suffer the effects of The Pathos Problem, but you should ignore their advice since it’s not reproducible if you aren’t them. Guys like Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, and Gordon Ramsey are all notorious for actively seeking negative feedback.Read more at location 586   

Rule of thumb: If you’ve mentioned your idea, people will try to protect your feelings.Read more at location 591   

“Whoops—I just slipped into pitch mode. I’m really sorry about that—I get excited about these things. Can we jump back to what you were just saying? You were telling me that…"Read more at location 602   

If they say they really want to hear about what you’re working on, promise that you’ll tell them at the end of the meeting or loop them in for an early demo,Read more at location 604   

Rule of thumb: Anyone will say your idea is great if you’re annoying enough about it.Read more at location 607   

You can’t learn anything useful unless you’re willing to spend a few minutes shutting up (even if you have something really smart to say).Read more at location 608   

In both cases, the listener was about to give you a privileged glimpse into their mental model of the world. Losing that learning is a shame.Read more at location 614   

Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing.Read more at location 617   

Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking a question which has the potential to completely destroy your currently imagined business.Read more at location 629   

once heard the general life advice that, for unpleasant tasks, you should imagine what you would have someone else do if you were delegating it. Then do that.Read more at location 635   

Similarly, if you have an exciting idea for a new product and go talk to a couple customers who don’t actually care about it, then that’s a great result. You just saved yourself however much time and money it would have cost to try building and selling it.Read more at location 647   

But really, that person’s opinion doesn’t matter. They have no idea if the business is going to work. Only the market knows.Read more at location 650   

You’re searching for the truth, not trying to be right. And you want to do it as quickly and cheaply as possible. Learning that your beliefs are wrong is frustrating, but it’s progress. It’s bringing you ever closer to the truth of a real problem and a good market.Read more at location 652   

The classic error in response to a lukewarm signal is to “up your game” and pitch them until they say something nice. Unless they’re holding a check, the only thing to gain from “convincing” them are false positives.Read more at location 662   

Rule of thumb: There’s more reliable information in a “meh” than a “Wow!” You can’t build a business on a lukewarm response.Read more at location 669   

I’d generally avoid mentioning the idea immediately since it gives them a good idea of which answers you’re hoping to hear.Read more at location 678   

A good conversation: You: “How often do you go to the gym?”  Them: “Um. Not really ever.” Looks like we’re done here. You: “Why not?” Instead of taking for granted that staying fit is one of their top priorities, let’s dig into the motivations. Them: “I don’t know, it’s just not something I’m that worried about, you know?” Not trying to fix this, so unlikely to buy or use an app. You: “When’s the last time you did try? Have you ever joined a gym or taken up jogging or anything?” Let’s anchor the generic just to make sure… Them: “Oh yeah, I used to be into sports in high school. It just hasn’t been a big deal since I settled down. Running around after the kids gives me all the cardio I need!” You: “Haha, gotcha. Thanks for the time!” This was a pleasant conversation and we learned what we came for, so we can abandon ship and leave him to his day.Read more at location 713   

For example, let’s say we help drive qualified leads to small business websites. We know that marketing is always a top 3 problem for small businesses, so we can focus on it and start the conversation by zooming in with a question like: You: What are your big problems with marketing? We can immediately zoom in on the problem if we are 100% certain it’s a must-solve problem which people are ready to pay for. Versus: You: What are your big problems right now? If we aren’t sure it’s a must-solve problem, we start more generic to see if they care at all about the problem category, in which case they’ll mention it.Read more at location 746   

To have a useful conversation, you need to zoom back out to ask about my blog in general, rather than marketing my blog.Read more at location 763   

At this point, you might be suspicious about how much I actually care about my blog. When it’s not clear whether a problem is a must-solve-right-now (e.g. you’re selling a painkiller) or a nice-to-have (you’re selling a vitamin), you can get some clarity by asking cost/value questions like the following. “Does-this-problem-matter” questions: “How seriously do you take your blog?”  “Do you make money from it?” “Have you tried making more money from it?” “How much time do you spend on it each week?” “Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?” “Which tools and services do you use for it?” “What are you already doing to improve this?” “What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?”Read more at location 786   

Rule of thumb: Start broad and don't zoom in until you’ve found a strong signal, both with your whole business and with every conversation.Read more at location 798   

The key phrase of “if you could get me more gigs” is basically shifting the burden from the customer to your product. Even though you’ve found a pain, your success is dependent on a bunch of other factors, such as your ability to grow a healthy supply of paying gigs which are a good fit for him. Will you be able to do that? It remains to be seen.Read more at location 835   

Similarly with affiliate commissions. If you sell a company’s products, you get a cut. That’s just how it works. You don’t need to explore or validate or understand their problems. The risk resides in your ability to get lots of traffic and sell lots of products. If you can, they’ll pay you.Read more at location 842   

In all of these examples, the risk is in your product, not in the market or the customer. The customer will pay if your product gets big enough.Read more at location 844   

Product risk — Can I build it? Can I grow it? Will they keep using it? Market risk — Do they want it? Will they pay? Are there enough of them?Read more at location 846   

When he talked to farmers, he asked questions like, “Would you switch trackers if something cheaper and more effective was available?” That’s the same as asking someone whether they would like more money. The answer is always “Yes.” The farmers responded along the lines of, “If you can build what you say you can build, I’ll equip my whole herd.” The problem is, he couldn’t build it. The risk was in the product.Read more at location 849   

Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to validate your game idea? “Do you like having fun?” “Would you like to have even more fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and almost none is in the customer. You know people buy games. If yours is good and you can find a way to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover people’s desire to play video games.Read more at location 858   

What all this does mean is that if you’ve got heavy product risk (as opposed to pure market risk), then you’re not going to be able to prove as much of your business through conversations alone. The conversations give you a starting point, but you’ll have to start building product earlier and with less certainty than if you had pure market risk.Read more at location 866   

Always pre-plan the 3 most important things you want to learn from any given type of person.Read more at location 869   

Rule of thumb: You always need a list of your 3 big questions.Read more at location 882   

We know that zooming prematurely and introducing your idea too early creates biases and can get you stuck on a local maximum.Read more at location 887   

In the early days, asking for the first conversation was simply impossible for me. I wasn’t credible enough, so nobody wanted to take a meeting just to talk to me about their day. Steve recommends starting with friendly first contacts. Definitely do that if you have them. Thanks to The Mom Test, the fact that they’re friends won’t bias your data, so long as you ask good questions. In my case though, I was entering a new industry with high walls (brand advertising) and no friendly first contacts.Read more at location 893   

Let’s say I’m trying to build tools to help public speakers get more speaking gigs and I bump into one at a conference.Read more at location 902   

Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting.Read more at location 911   

was considering a product idea to make office managers more efficient. I played with the possibilities on Friday, figured out the big questions over the weekend, and then went to an industry event on Monday.Read more at location 925   

Rule of thumb: If it feels like they’re doing you a favour by talking to you, it’s probably too formal.Read more at location 938   

The chats grow longer as you move from the early broad questions (“Is this a real problem?”) toward more specific product and industry issues (“Which other software do we have to integrate with to close the sale?”).Read more at location 940   

once had a product idea to help busy investors to manage their dealflow. I knew they got hundreds of applications per month and figured it must be a spreadsheet nightmare. I lined up a couple meetings to ask about the industry. I showed up to the first meeting and, while making smalltalk, said something like “I was thinking, you guys must get a ton of leads, right?” The guy laughed and said, yeah, it was crazy. “How in the world do you deal with all of that?” He sort of shrugged and pointed at a cluster of about a dozen sticky notes on the wall.  Each held a name and a phone number. “Our analysts kill most of them before they ever reach us, and then we throw out a bunch more.Read more at location 960   

They don’t have the problem. That’s successful learning. We disproved our idea before the guy even realised we were talking about it.Read more at location 967   

Rule of thumb: Give as little information as possible about your idea while still nudging the discussion in a useful direction.Read more at location 974   

The good news is that since we have the beginnings of a product, we're now in a position to cut through the false positives by asking for commitments.Read more at location 980   

By giving them a clear chance to either commit or reject us, we get out of the friend-zone and can identify the real leads.Read more at location 987   

Commitment — They are showing they’re serious by giving up something they value such as time, reputation, or money.  Advancement — They are moving to the next step of your real-world funnel and getting closer to a sale.Read more at location 994   

Rule of thumb: “Customers” who keep being friendly but aren’t ever going to buy are a particularly dangerous source of mixed signals.Read more at location 999   

there’s no such thing as a meeting which just "went well". Every meeting either succeeds or fails.Read more at location 1002   

A meeting has succeeded when it ends with a commitment to advance to the next step.Read more at location 1004   

You know how to deal with compliments by now: deflect, ignore, and get back to business.Read more at location 1009   

Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what happens next after a product or sales meeting, the meeting was pointless.Read more at location 1016   

The major currencies are time, reputation risk, and cash.Read more at location 1019   

time commitment could include:  Clear next meeting with known goals Sitting down to give feedback on wireframes Using a trial themselves for a non-trivial period Reputation risk commitments might be:  Intro to peers or team Intro to a decision maker (boss, spouse, lawyer) Giving a public testimonial or case study Financial commitments are easier to imagine and include: Letter of intent (non-legal but gentlemanly agreement to purchase) Pre-order DepositRead more at location 1020   

Sometimes, strong commitments combine multiple currencies, such as someone agreeing to run a paid trial with their whole team, thus risking their time, money, and reputation.Read more at location 1026   

Rule of thumb: The more they’re giving up, the more seriously you can take their kind words.Read more at location 1030   

To fix it, you need to shift from fuzzy future promises into concrete current commitments. For example, you could ask for a letter of intent, a pre-purchase or deposit, or intros to other decision makers and team members. Kickstarter is so wonderful because it forces customers who say they would buy it to actually pull out a credit card and commit.Read more at location 1069   

If you've got a more developed product, you can take their credit card and just charge them nothing if they cancel within 30 days. The more they are giving up for you, the more seriously you can take their validation.Read more at location 1078   

The worst meetings are the wishy-washy ones that you leave with neither rejection nor advancement. You are in no-man’s-land and you won’t learn anything until you fix the meeting by forcing a next step (or rejection).Read more at location 1091   

Rule of thumb: It’s not a real lead until you’ve given them a concrete chance to reject you.Read more at location 1099   

There is a significant difference between: “Yeah, that’s a problem” and “THAT IS THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE AND I WILL PAY YOU RIGHT NOW TO FIX IT.”Read more at location 1116   

Rule of thumb: In early stage sales, the real goal is learning. Revenue is just a side-effect.Read more at location 1132   

I know one team who successfully used cold LinkedIn messages to reach C-level execs of several major UK retailers. They were ignored by practically every exec in the country, but you only need one to say “yes” to start the intro train.Read more at location 1150   

The only thing people love talking about more than themselves is their problems.Read more at location 1158   

Joel Gascoigne did a classic "landing page" test with his startup Buffer, describing the value proposition and collecting emails. But contrary to popular understanding, it wasn't the metrics or conversion rate which convinced him to move forward. Instead, it was the conversations which resulted from emailing every single person who signed up and saying hello.Read more at location 1181   

Paul Graham recommends a generic launch for the same purposes. Get your product out there, see who seems to like it most, and then reach out to those users.Read more at location 1185   

Want to figure out the problems HR professionals have? Organise an event called “HR professionals happy hour”. People will assume you’re credible just because you happen to be the person who sent the invite emails or introduced the speaker. You'll have an easy time chatting to them about their problems.Read more at location 1196   

Spend the time to teach. You'll find chances at conferences, workshops, through online videos, blogging, or doing free consulting or office hours.Read more at location 1204   

If you have a reasonably sized and relevant blog audience, lining up conversations is a total non-issue. You just write a post about it and ask people to get in touch. Of course, not everyone has a relevant audience.Read more at location 1209   

Every business is different. Don't just copy what someone else is doing. Consider your own situation, and then get clever.Read more at location 1221   

The world is a relatively small place. Everyone knows someone. We just have to remember to ask.Read more at location 1226   

I relied heavily on advisors in my first company. We didn't know the industry and nobody took us seriously. Our 5 advisors each had around a half percent of equity and basically just made credible intros.Read more at location 1234

The framing format I like has 5 key elements. You're an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don't mention your idea. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you're at and, if it's true, that you don't have anything to sell. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning your specific problem that you're looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you're not a time waster. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help. Ask for help. Or, in shorter form: Vision / Framing / Weakness / Pedestal / AskRead more at location 1270   

Hey Pete,  I'm trying to make desk & office rental less of a pain for new businesses (vision). We're just starting out and don't have anything to sell, but want to make sure we're building something that actually helps (framing).  I've only ever come at it from the tenant's side and I'm having a hard time understanding how it all works from the landlord's perspective (weakness). You've been renting out desks for a while and could really help me cut through the fog (pedestal).  Do you have time in the next couple weeks to meet up for a chat? (ask)Read more at location 1278   

Hey Scott, I run a startup trying to make advertising more playful and ultimately effective (vision).  We're having a load of trouble figuring out how all the pieces of the industry fit together and where we can best fit into it (weakness). You know more about this industry than anyone and could really save us from a ton of mistakes (pedestal).  We're funded and have a couple products out already, but this is in no way a sales meeting -- we're just moving into a new area and could really use some of your expertise (framing).  Can you spare a bit of time in the next week to help point us in the right direction over a coffee? (ask)Read more at location 1287   

That being said, some other great people in the field like and recommend phone calls. Use whatever works. But I will say that you should start in person. It’s too easy to use surveys or phone calls as an excuse to skip the awkwardness of meeting in person rather than as a considered trade-off.Read more at location 1325   

The UX community (who knows their customer conversation!) says you should keep talking to people until you stop hearing new information.  In my experience, that could take as few as 3-5 conversations if you have a relatively simple industry and a focused customer segment.Read more at location 1343   

Rule of thumb: Keep having conversations until you stop hearing new stuff.Read more at location 1350   

But they didn’t start there. If you start too generic, everything is watered down. Your marketing message is generic. You suffer feature creep. Google helped PhD students find obscure bits of code. EBay helped collectors buy and sell Pez dispensers. Evernote helped moms save and share recipes.Read more at location 1360   

Before we can serve everyone, we have to serve someone. By thinking about who would be most likely to buy, she realised it was moms with young kids who are currently shopping at health food stores.Read more at location 1373   

Rule of thumb: If you aren’t finding consistent problems and goals, you don’t yet have a specific enough customer segment.Read more at location 1425   

If you’ve already got a product and users, you can explore your way to a good segment by seeing who likes it and focusing on that group.Read more at location 1427   

This drilling down into ever more specific groups is called Customer Slicing. You take a segment and then keep slicing off better and better sub-sets of it until you’ve got a tangible sense of who you can go talk to and where you can find them.Read more at location 1432   

Start with a broad segment and ask: Within this group, which type of this person would want it most? Would everyone within this group buy/use it, or only some of them? Why do they want it? (e.g. What is their problem or goal) Does everyone in the group have that motivation or only some of them? What additional motivations are there? Which other types of people have these motivations?Read more at location 1434   

We now have a two groups of segments: the first is a collection of quite specific demographic groups and the second is a series of motivations.Read more at location 1438   

Are any of these groups un-findable? If so, go back up the list and slice them into finer pieces until you know where to find them. A customer segment isn’t very useful if there’s no way you can get in touch!Read more at location 1443   

Now that we have a bunch of who-where pairs, we can decide who to start with based on who seems most: Profitable Easy to reach Rewarding for us to build a business aroundRead more at location 1445   

If this was my business, I would probably shift my preferred customer segment from “students” to “people scared of public speaking who are trying to get better.” I would start by going to a Toastmasters meetup since I could have a dozen conversations over the course of the evening by Keeping it Casual. That one evening would give me a great starting point for understanding the motivations, worldview, and needs of a large group of totally ideal customers who are already spending time and money to try to get better.Read more at location 1465   

Rule of thumb: Good customer segments are a who-where pair. If you don’t know where to go to find your customers, keep slicing your segment into smaller pieces until you do.Read more at location 1477   

Some founders react with hostility to the whole idea. They’ll say something along the lines of, “We need to be building the gosh derned product, not fuffing around talking to people.” On the surface, it appears to be a refusal to face the reality that there might be something wrong with the product’s foundations. But having seen it in several teams now, I think it’s actually the desire for speed, where speed is measured by building features instead of by de-risking and validating the business.Read more at location 1531   

Rule of thumb: If you don’t know what you’re trying to learn, you shouldn’t bother having the conversation.Read more at location 1547   

You can't outsource or hire someone to do customer learning. There are exceptional team dynamics where it works, but generally speaking, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves. When a hired gun brings you bad news (“This problem isn't real and nobody cares about what we're doing”), properly assimilating it is difficult.Read more at location 1571   

More insidiously, if the signal is lukewarm, it’s tempting for a hire to gloss over it. Hiring out your learning is a guaranteed way to get bad signals. Until you've got a working business model and a repeatable sales or marketing process, the founders need to be in the meetings themselves.Read more at location 1574   

As we discussed, feature requests usually get ignored, but they're a good signal to capture and explore. Must-have purchasing criteria are obviously more important. Money signals are also key.Read more at location 1605

Talking to customers is a tool, not an obligation. If it’s not going to help or you don’t want to do it for whatever reason, just skip it. I’m sure you’ve been on the receiving end of a half-assed survey sent out by some new startup to tick the box marked “learn from customers” on their startup todo list. There are better ways to waste your time.Read more at location 1644   

Don’t spend a week prepping for meetings; spend an hour and then go talk to people. Anything more is stalling.  Don’t spend months doing full-time customer conversations before beginning to move on a product. Spend a week, maybe two. Get your bearings and then give them something to commit to.Read more at location 1673

When we find a new and exciting process, it’s easy to spend hours obsessively geeking out about exactly the right way to untie this big, gnarly knot.Read more at location 1704   

He looked at us like we were all idiots and held up his phone. “Why wouldn’t I just call them?” It’s not like he didn’t know their number. We all stood around a bit dumbfounded while he went outside and called the police. Twenty minutes later, he came back in with a trial session scheduled.  Having a process is valuable, but don’t get stuck in it. Sometimes you can just pick up the phone and hack through the knot.Read more at location 1711
