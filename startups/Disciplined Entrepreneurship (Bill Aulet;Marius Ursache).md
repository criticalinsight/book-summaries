When we look at Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, and all the other highly visible entrepreneurs, they seem to be different from us. They seem extraordinary. But each of their successes is a result of great products that made them successful, not some special gene.

The real reason why MIT is so successful at creating new companies is a combination of spirit and skills. At MIT there is a culture that encourages people to start companies all the time and everywhere, much like in Silicon Valley, Israel, Tech City in London, and Berlin today. Role models are everywhere, and they are not abstract icons, but rather very real people no different from you.

Innovation-Driven Enterprise (IDE) Entrepreneurship Innovation-driven enterprise (IDE) entrepreneurship is the more risky and more ambitious of the two. IDE entrepreneurs are aspiring to serve markets that go well beyond the local market. They are looking to sell their offering at a global or at least at a regional level. These entrepreneurs usually work in teams where they build their business off some technology, process, business model, or other innovation that will give them a significant competitive advantage as compared to existing companies.

Innovation = Invention ∗ Commercialization I modify Roberts’s definition, which involved addition, because innovation is not a sum of invention and commercialization, but a product. If there is commercialization but no invention (invention = 0), or invention but no commercialization (commercialization = 0), then there is no innovation.

The invention (an idea, a technology, or some sort of intellectual property) is important, but the entrepreneur does not need to create the invention. In fact, the inventions that lead to innovation-driven companies often come from elsewhere. Such was the case with Steve Jobs, who identified others’ inventions (the computer mouse created by Xerox PARC is the most famous example) and commercialized them effectively through Apple. Likewise at Google, which has made most of its money through AdWords, the text-based, keyword-driven advertisements on their search results pages.

Some of the most exciting innovations of our time, such as Google, iTunes, Salesforce.com, Netflix, Zipcar, and many more are, at their core, business model innovations. They are enabled by technology, yes—Zipcar would find it difficult to maintain its large network of cars without keyless-entry technology for its members.

You can do this exercise either alone or with a group of potential co-founders. Consider the following: Knowledge: What was the focus of your education or career? Capability: What are you most proficient at? Connections: Who do you know that has expertise in different industries? Do you know other entrepreneurs? Financial assets: Do you have access to significant financial capital, or will you be relying on a meager savings account to start out? Name recognition: What are you or your partners well-known for? Skills in engineering? Understanding fiber optics? Past work experience: In previous jobs you’ve held, what inefficiencies or “pain points” existed? Passion for a particular market: Does the idea of improving healthcare excite you? How about education? Energy? Transportation? Commitment: Do you have the time and effort to devote to this endeavor? Are you ready to make a new venture your primary (or only) focus? If you or your founding group have strong coding and project management skills, you may be more inclined to develop a web app. If you are a pro at rapid prototyping, you may want to consider creating a physical product of some sort. Or if your past work experience is in education or medicine, you may want to consider what you can create that would improve those areas.

For instance, if you are expressing your idea as “I want to create an online social network for high school teachers and parents to communicate about their children’s progress in school,” you may lock yourself into a path that does not produce a sustainable business. Start instead with “I want to improve education with technology.” Then ask yourself why you are passionate about that idea. If technology is your primary passion, you probably want to consider a wider range of industries than just education. If your passion is education, you can simply segment the education industry, but be open to other solutions besides one involving a high degree of technology.

How do you tell if your market is targeted enough? You want to continue segmenting until your market opportunity matches the three conditions that define a market. This definition expands on one that Geoffrey Moore presents in Inside the Tornado. Three Conditions That Define a Market 1. The customers within the market all buy similar products. 2. The customers within the market have a similar sales cycle and expect products to provide value in similar ways. Your salespeople can shift from selling to one customer to selling to a different customer and still be very effective with little or no loss of productivity. 3. There is “word of mouth” between customers in the market, meaning they can serve as compelling and high-value references for each other in making purchases. For example, they may belong to the same professional organizations or operate in the same region. If you find a potential market opportunity where the customers do not talk to each other, you will find it difficult for your startup to gain traction. These three criteria for defining a market mean that you will get efficiencies of scale in the market and you have a good chance to do that magical thing that all startups want, “to go viral.”

Eventually, they settled on one of the subsegments, extreme athletes in their thirties who do triathlons. These athletes are extremely competitive with a lot of disposable income that they spend on their fitness. When the team approached a number of these athletes with their idea, they were extremely positive toward the concept (or potential product).

It is possible that an initial TAM of $5 million per year could be a successful business, if you can capture the market quickly and convincingly, especially if the gross margins on your product would be very high (e.g., 90 percent as it would be for software, mobile apps, information-based business models) and you do not need a lot of employees to do it.

SHOULD I CREATE MULTIPLE PERSONAS? IF SO, WHEN? As we discussed in Step 1 when talking about how we define “customers,” companies similar in nature to eBay and Google should actually start out with two Personas. This is not due to a lack of focus, but rather to the fact that their core businesses are two-sided markets; so they needed one Persona for each market.

Building a brochure helps you to see your product from the customer’s point of view and provides you with a concrete “straw man” to test with your customer (Figure 7.1). It forces you to see your new venture from your customer’s vantage point, in their words. It also allows you to validate your ideas and learn if you are on the right track.

As such, we first determined the average time to market for a new toy using the current software available. We were careful to see the development process the way the customer does—in this case the toy manufacturer—using the customer’s own words to describe the process. We iterated with one toy manufacturer until they believed we had it right; we then went to another toy manufacturer to see if their process was similar. After a while, we believed we had defined a very good “as-is” state for the process that captured the essence without getting into insignificant details.

The 50 percent reduction in time to market our offered product could mean both increased profits of hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars per toy or shoe line. We did not have to express our value proposition in dollars because the actual dollar amount would vary widely. Also, manufacturers were fluent enough in their process to know what a 50 percent reduction in time meant for them. The manufacturers could take that number to anyone in the company and they would understand that value. This worked extremely well and is an excellent example of a Quantified Value Proposition.

The Quantified Value Proposition is framed by the top priority of the Persona. You first need to understand and map the “as-is” state in a way familiar to the customer, using the Full Life Cycle Use Case. Then, map out the “possible” state of using your product, clearly indicating where the customer receives value based on the Persona’s top priority. A visual, one-page diagram is best, because the customer can easily see the Quantified Value Proposition and can show it to others for validation. When done well, this will be of immense value to you throughout the process of launching your business, so extra effort spent to get this optimized is well worth it.

Throughout the 24 Steps, your purpose is not to complete each step with 100 percent accuracy, but rather to test hypotheses and to learn from your potential customers. Getting negative results will happen and how the entrepreneurial team responds to them will be a fundamental factor to the team’s success. Therefore, if any step returns negative feedback, meaning feedback that does not support your hypotheses, you have received valuable information that there may be an error in the research and data you have been using up to this point. Negative results at one step is not the end of the venture in most cases, but moving forward with a faulty plan that was based on hope and not facts is a recipe for failure.

One common starting point when determining your Core is to conclude it is your intellectual property. Its effectiveness as a Core depends heavily on your industry. In the medical industry, especially the biotech industry, patents are incredibly important in ensuring success of a product or a new company.

CORE IS DIFFERENT THAN COMPETITIVE POSITION Your customers very likely will not see your Core as the reason they buy from you. They will instead look at your Competitive Position, which you will map in Step 11. Your Core will drive your ability to deliver certain benefits to the customer, which has to translate into value for the customer (based on the customer’s top priorities), which then leads to a better Competitive Position. The Core is how you are building a capability to differentiate yourself from your competitors, and it cannot be easily replicated by others. It is the most concentrated way to gain differentiation from your current and potential competitors so you can really focus your small amount of resources to gain maximum value for your new venture.

The Core is what you have that your competitors do not, that you will protect over time above all else, and that you continually work over time to develop and enhance. Once you agree on a Core, it should not change without a great deal of thought; instead, you should continually make your Core stronger. If it changes often, this is a bad sign because it means you are likely not building it effectively. However, it can change as you discover what your customers value most and what you do best.

HOW TO MAP THE PROCESS The following items from the Full Life Cycle Use Case (Step 6) will be the basis for mapping the process to acquire a paying customer. You do not need to do additional work on these items in order to use them in this step. How customers will determine they have a need and/or opportunity to move away from their status quo and how to activate customers to feel they have to do something different (purchasing your product). How customers will find out about your product. How customers will analyze your product. How customers will acquire your product. How customers will install your product. How customers will pay for your product.

Use the same general methodology to calculate the TAM for each follow-on market that you did for your beachhead TAM in Step 4. If you want to attract venture capital and/or build a big business, the general rule is that the broader TAM (for 10 or less follow-on markets), plus your beachhead market TAM, should add up to over $1B.

Once usage has started, they can justify the purchase of some consumable product the solution uses.

SUMMARY Pricing is primarily about determining how much value your customer gets from your product, and capturing a fraction of that value back for your business. Costs are irrelevant to determining your pricing structure. You will be able to charge a higher price to early customers as opposed to later customers, but be flexible in offering special, one-time-only discounts to select early testers and lighthouse customers, as they will be far more beneficial to your product’s success than the average early customer. Unlike your business model, pricing will continually change, both as a result of information you gather and as you progress throughout the 24 Steps, as well as in response to market conditions.

The LTV was $1 and the TAM very limited. It was not even a social or interactive fad that had much of a viral component, and as such, might not only increase the TAM but also make it more likely it would come back, like a yo-yo or hula hoop.

SUMMARY The Lifetime Value of an Acquired Customer calculation is the profit that a new customer will provide on average, discounted to reflect the high cost of acquiring capital that a startup faces. It is important to be realistic, not optimistic, when calculating LTV, and to know the underlying drivers behind LTV so you can work to increase it. You will be comparing the LTV to COCA. An LTV:COCA ratio of 3:1 or higher is what you will be aiming for.

While your customer-centric focus means you have created a product the customer wants, your product is still new to the world, so you will need direct interaction with the customer to explain your value proposition and why your product is unique.

Key questions that your sales process should address include: How does your target customer become aware that they have a problem or an opportunity? How will the target customer learn that there is a solution to this problem they have, or learn there is the opportunity they did not previously know about? Once the target customer knows about your business, what is the education process that allows them to make a well-informed analysis about whether to purchase your product? How do you make the sale? How do you collect the money? Once you have developed the sales process, vet it with experienced professionals in the industry.

SALES PROCESS COMPARISONS: ZYNGA, GROUPON, LINKEDIN, FACEBOOK Looking at web companies, you can see that a variety of strategies can be employed to reach customers, ranging from fully involved salespeople to no salespeople at all. FarmVille maker Zynga chose a viral approach to greatly reduce the need for salespeople. Groupon’s model, by contrast, required heavy direct sales involvement to acquire merchants as customers, resulting in a high and steady COCA that affected the company’s profit margin; however, on the other side of its two-sided market, Groupon has had its daily deals spread virally by effectively incenting consumers to spread word of deals to their friends. LinkedIn has a more refined model. They started with highly selective online ads and some direct salespeople (to sell their recruiting package). Once they got market traction and a reasonable critical mass, they started to rely much more heavily on users recruiting their colleagues to join the site through a well-developed system of easy-to-send invitations, coupled with an effective algorithm suggesting possible new connections. This system quickly started sending e-mails to people outside the network to join if they were not already in. Once the company achieved high levels of market penetration, it focused its algorithm on making recommendations of people already on the site, to encourage more connections the user can make, keeping the user coming back and more deeply invested in the site so that switching would be more and more difficult. Facebook has similarly been able to leverage a network effect to bring in new users at very little cost, then increasingly tie them to their network with a similar algorithm to suggest likely people the user would like to be linked to.

Typically, in the early stages of the sales process, the COCA exceeds the Lifetime Value of an Acquired Customer. In sustainable businesses, the COCA decreases over time until it is significantly less than the LTV. One of the key questions for your business is how long it will take for the COCA to drop below the LTV of a customer, because until you reach that point, your business is spending more money than it is taking in

6. Choose Your Business Model with COCA in Mind: The design of your Business Model can dramatically affect your COCA, as Jim Dougherty learned at IntraLinks, the company providing a secure online space for investment bankers and lawyers to share documents with their clients. His business model was based on usage, but it was hard to sell to customers because they could not easily plan how much they would spend on the product. When he switched to a “cell phone” type of model, where customers paid a fixed amount each month for an agreed-upon type of service, with the flexibility to buy additional service on a usage basis, it became much easier to sell the product to customers, and the sales cycle length decreased dramatically.

7. Word of Mouth: The biggest driver of reducing COCA is positive word of mouth about a company and its product. This tends to dramatically decrease the sales cycle, decrease the customer’s desire to push you for discounts, and bring in well-qualified customers who already are good fits for the product, so salespeople can be much more productive in dealing with them. Many companies today, large and small, attempt to drive this by measuring it using the Net Promoter Score index and system.

SUMMARY Identifying key assumptions is the first part of the process to validate your primary market research by looking for customers to take specific actions, which will happen in the next step. Before the assumptions can be tested, they need to be broken down into their component parts, so that each assumption represents a specific, narrow idea that can be empirically tested in the next step using a single experiment design. Do not worry about how you will design the experiment yet. Focus on breaking out all the key assumptions, because if you skip over an assumption fearing that testing it is difficult, you will neglect a potentially important factor in your business’s health.

With key assumptions identified, you will now design experiments to test these assumptions in the cheapest, quickest, and easiest ways possible. The goal is to gather empirical data that either supports or disproves your assumptions. These experiments will not require much, if any, in the way of building physical goods or writing code, but rather logical thinking to design simple yet effective tests.

Furthermore, if you run a bunch of experiments with different hypotheses off the top of your head, and some of the experiments seem to succeed, that by itself does not guarantee success. Remember, in social science research, you do not prove hypotheses so much as disprove hypotheses; so a successful experiment only suggests a successful venture. The combination of your primary market research and the empirical experiments you will perform in this step will lead you to more fully understand your customer and increase your likelihood of being successful.

This team wanted to offer a smartphone-based personal shopping assistant to young people who shop at health food stores like Whole Foods Market. The students on the team used their smartphones when they shopped, so they assumed that others did so as well. This was a key assumption that needed to be tested. To test the assumption, the team went to a Whole Foods and observed shoppers who fit the description of their demographic. Virtually none of the shoppers used a smartphone while in the store. The team was incredulous, but confirmed the result at a different Whole Foods location. The team interviewed shoppers and found that while many of them owned iPhones (the experiment was conducted around the time the iPhone was first released), they were not interested in using them while shopping because they already had a way of shopping that worked well for them and did not want to change.

This second attempt was compared to a different state’s presidential primary, and achieved results similar to the professional polls that cost $100,000 and several days to produce. Interestingly, while validating his hypothesis, he found an even more interesting use for his idea—pollsters were interested in using Facebook’s demographic targeting of ads to organize hypertargeted focus groups, a market opportunity with much broader application than simply predicting the results of an election.

I gave them an “A” for the assignment. Testing this assumption was also a lot more fun for the team than coming up with some abstract rationale—and it was more powerful.

SUMMARY Testing key assumptions, particularly the most significant assumptions, such as cost targets and interest of lighthouse customers, prepares you well to sell your product because it complements the primary market research–based approach you have already taken. The convergence of your market research with empirical results from your experiments prepares you to put together a first-pass product and sell to customers.

Your MVBP should balance simplicity with sufficiency. As Einstein said, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.” Your odds of success are higher if you limit the number of variables in your initial product, getting something that works into the customer’s hands quickly, even if it does not have all the functionality you would like to include. The goal is straightforward—make a list of all of your key assumptions, narrow your assumptions to the most important, put it/them into a product the customer can use, and see if they will buy it.

In this example, determining the Minimum Viable Business Product tested the most important assumptions possible to get the iterative learning feedback loop started: 1. Can we get patients to sign up? 2. Will they use the system? 3. Can we get doctors to sign up? 4. Can we get paid for this in general? 5. We’ve done customer research, but how can we determine if these are the features that customers really want? 6. Are these the features that customers will pay for? 7. Are these the features that customers will always want, or does it appear that their preferences will change over time? All the other sexy stuff such as the Kinect system could be added later; but for now, Tim had chosen his Minimum Viable Business Product wisely and was not distracted by the exciting vision and technology. He had simplified the definition of his MVBP and could now test his key assumptions in a product, beginning the iterative customer feedback loop

Without investing much money or going too far down a single path, Kendall and Ryan’s goal was to show that women would like the value proposition enough to sign up, open the e-mails and tell their friends. They were very confident they could add more features later; but they wanted to get more guidance after these original foundational features were implemented and used to know which ones to add and in what priority. They wanted to start the feedback loop with their target customers as soon as possible. This MVBP also set them up well to test whether the secondary customer got value from the product and was willing to pay for access to the primary customer, since the MVBP has links that allow women to click to websites on which clothing items are sold.

The first challenge they faced was figuring out how to make an MVBP when their value proposition hinged around bringing all the channels together in a simplified way. Early on they decided to build only the necessary integrations, those that required real-time response: Facebook and Twitter for social media. These were basic features without the bells and whistles. You could link your accounts and schedule a post, but you couldn’t comment or even monitor your feeds. They decided also to develop an e-mail builder for customers to send e-mail campaigns. It used a basic e-mail editor, which provided limited editing functionality. Whenever the channels allowed for delays, they would just “fake it before you make it.” A good example of this is the Postcard Builder. When a user hit the button to send a postcard, they would be able to upload a file and a list. They would see the additional cost right there and then they would hit “Send.” Instead of building a system integration with a partner, in reality this sent an e-mail to the team with the details around the postcard. Someone would then go login to the third-party provider website and set the postcard to get printed, posted, and delivered on the date it was scheduled for. By faking it, they were able to see if people would use and be willing to pay for certain features before having to make the major investments to build them.

It is critical to first see if the target customer will buy and accept the product; but it is also important now to start to measure how much they will advocate to others in the TAM about the benefits of your product. What is the magnitude of the positive word of mouth your product is generating? This is often referred to as the virality coefficient. So in this step, measure if at all possible whether your customers tell others about your product, because this creates valuable word of mouth that will decrease your Cost of Customer Acquisition.

It was easy to track this quantitatively via the referral link through which members signed up. Despite not spending money on marketing in the first few months, word spread to 1,500 people based on pure word-of-mouth traction and minimal press coverage.

More than 15 percent of the customer base was consistently being driven by existing customer referrals (without incentives). More than 50 percent of the businesses that had been with ThriveHive since the launch of the paid product were expanding their businesses due to marketing success that they attributed in large part to ThriveHive.

SUMMARY Establishing a product plan is similar to the step to calculate the broader TAM. The idea is to get you thinking ahead so you raise your sightlines and don’t get too bogged down in your beachhead market, which is only your first step as a business. You want to expand from the beachhead. It gives you a long-term vision that keeps you reaching and thinking ahead, especially in the design of your product and organization. Do not spend too much time here, though, because you still need to get the dogs to eat the dog food today, or else you will run out of money long before entering adjacent markets. Plans will change as you learn more from the beachhead, but to not have a plan is to put yourself in the hands of luck as opposed to your own methodical process.
