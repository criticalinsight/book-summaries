Never, ever say that you have no competitors. That signals naivete. Great markets draw competitors, and so if you really have no competition, you must not be in a great market.


Marketing risk — first, make sure your differentiation is super-sharp, because without that, you probably won’t be able to stand out from the noise.


The most valuable thing you can do is actually build your product. When in doubt, focus on that.


The next most valuable thing you can do is get customers — or, for a consumer Internet service, establish a pattern of page view growth.


This post is all about the only thing that matters for a new startup.


And so you start to wonder — what correlates the most to success — team, product, or market? Or, more bluntly, what causes success? And, for those of us who are students of startup failure — what’s most dangerous: a bad team, a weak product, or a poor market?


Here’s the classic scenario: the world’s best software application for an operating system nobody runs. Just ask any software developer targeting the market for BeOS, Amiga, OS/2, or NeXT applications what the difference is between great product and big market.


Personally, I’ll take the third position — I’ll assert that market is the most important factor in a startup’s success or failure.


In a great market — a market with lots of real potential customers — the market pulls product out of the startup.


The market needs to be fulfilled and the market will be fulfilled, by the first viable product that comes along.


The product doesn’t need to be great; it just has to basically work. And, the market doesn’t care how good the team is, as long as the team can produce that viable product.


Conversely, in a terrible market, you can have the best product in the world and an absolutely killer team, and it doesn’t matter — you’re going to fail.


When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins. When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins. When a great team meets a great market, something special happens.


Hopefully a great team gets you at least an OK product, and ideally a great product.


Markets that don’t exist don’t care how smart you are.


teams whose startups were highly successful due to explosively large markets for what they were doing.


“A great team is a team that will always beat a mediocre team, given the same market and product.”


Short of that, I wouldn’t count on your product creating a new market from scratch.


The only thing that matters is getting to product/market fit.


Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.


Lots of startups fail before product/market fit ever happens.


When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.


Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required. When you get right down to it, you can ignore almost everything else.


Ironically, once a startup is successful, and you ask the founders what made it successful, they will usually cite all kinds of things that had nothing to do with it. People are terrible at understanding causation. But in almost every case, the cause was actually product/market fit.


Some signs of cultural corrosion caused by raising too much money:


Hiring too many people — slows everything down and makes it much harder for you to react and change. You are almost certainly setting yourself up for layoffs in the future, even if you are successful, because you probably won’t accurately allocate the hiring among functions for what you will really need as your business grows.


Lazy management culture — it is easy for a management culture to get set where the manager’s job is simply to hire people, and then every other aspect of management suffers, with potentially disastrous long-term consequences to morale and effectiveness.


So what should you do if you do raise a lot of money? As my old boss Jim Barksdale used to say, the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing — be just as focused on product and customers when you raise a lot of money as you would be if you hadn’t raised a lot of money.


Continue to run as lean as you can, bank as much of the money as possible, and save it for a rainy day — or a nuclear winter.


Illustrate that point by staying as scrappy as possible on material items — office space, furniture, etc. The two areas to splurge, in my opinion, are big-screen monitors and ergonomic office chairs. Other than that, it should be Ikea all the way.


A startup’s initial business plan doesn’t matter that much, because it is very hard to determine up front exactly what combination of product and market will result in success. By definition you will be doing something new, in a world that is a very uncertain place.  You are simply probably not going to know whether your initial idea will work as a product and a business, or not.  And you will probably have to rapidly evolve your plan — possibly every aspect of it — as you go.


It is therefore much more important for a startup to aggressively seek out a big market, and product/market fit within that market, once the startup is up and running, than it is to try to plan out what you are going to do in great detail ahead of time.


One of the most critical things a startup founder must do is develop a top-notch executive team.


Be a primary individual contributor– a startup executive must “roll up her sleeves” and produce output herself. There are no shortage of critical things to be done at a startup, and an executive who cannot personally produce while simultaneously building and running her organization typically will not last long.


First, if you’re not sure whether you need an executive for a function, don’t hire one.


Hire for what you need now


Third, whenever possible, promote from within.


Look for someone who is hungry and driven– someone who wants a shot at doing “their thing”. Someone who has been an up and comer at a midsized company but wants a shot at being a primary executive at a startup can be a great catch.


Don’t disqualify someone based on ego or cockiness– as long as she’s not insane. Great executives are high-ego — you want someone driven to run things, driven to make decisions, confident in herself and her abilities. I


Back in the 80’s, you often heard, “never hire anyone straight out of IBM — first, let them go somewhere else and fail, and then hire them”. Believe it.


First, manage your executives.


This means weekly 1:1’s, performance reviews, written objectives, career development plans, the whole nine yards.


This is the balancing act with the previous point, but it’s equally important. Don’t micromanage.


The whole point of having an executive is to have someone who can figure out how to build and run an organization so that you don’t have to.


Third, ruthlessly violate the chain of command in order to gather data.


Here’s the kicker: a great executive never minds when the CEO talks to people in her organization. In fact, she loves it, because it means the CEO just hears more great things about her.


However, life is short, startups move fast, and you have stuff to get done. You aren’t going to have the privilege of working with that many great, talented, high-potential people in your career. When you find one, promote her as fast as you can. Great for her, great for the company, and great for you.


The surest sign someone is ready for promotion is when they’re doing a great job running their current team. Projects are getting done, team morale is good, new hires are top quality, people are happy. Time to promote some people into new challenges.


But, an executive can cause far more damage than a normal employee. A normal employee doesn’t work out, fine, replace him.


Second, the minute you have a bad feeling in your gut, start gathering data.


Is it painful for you to interact with the executive?Do you try to avoid or cancel your 1:1’s? Does talking to her give you a headache? Do you often not understand what point she’s trying to make or why she’s focused on such an odd issue? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, you have a problem.


Fourth, don’t feel guilty.


Anyone who got a job as an executive at a startup is going to have an easy time getting the next job. After all, she can always paint you as a crazy founder, or inept CEO.


Specifically, there are times and situations where micromanaging executives is not just ok, but also the right thing to do. Andy Grove has an excellent explanation of this in his classic book High Output Management, where he describes a concept called “Task Relevant Maturity”. Andy explains that employees who are immature in a given task require detailed training and instruction. They need to be micromanaged. On the other hand, if an employee is relatively mature in a task, then it is counterproductive and annoying to manage the details of their work.


So, micromanagement is like fine wine. A little at the right times will really enhance things; too much all the time and you’ll end up in rehab.


If you don’t have anyone on your founding team who is capable of being CEO, then sell your company — now.


Here’s what I think those criteria are. Drive I define drive as self-motivation — people who will walk right through brick walls, on their own power, without having to be asked, to achieve whatever goal is in front of them.


People with drive push and push and push and push and push until they succeed.


Driven people don’t tend to stay long at places where they can’t succeed, and just because they haven’t succeeded in the wrong companies doesn’t mean they won’t succeed at your company — if they’re driven.


I think you can see drive in a candidate’s eyes, and in a candidate’s background.


The business you started and ran in high school.


The nonprofit you started and ran in college.


If you’re a programmer: the open source project to which you’ve made major contributions.


And you’re not going to change them.


Motivating people who are fundamentally unmotivated is not easy.


But motivating people who are self-motivated is wind at your back.


I like specifically looking for someone for which this job is their big chance to really succeed.


I also like specifically looking for someone who comes from some kind of challenging background — a difficult family situation, say, or someone who had to work his/her way through school — who is nevertheless on par with his/her more fortunate peers in skills and knowledge.


People used to say, back when IBM owned the industry: never hire someone straight out of IBM. First, let them go somewhere else and fail. Then, once they’ve realized the real world is not like IBM, hire them and they’ll be great.


Curiosity Curiosity is a proxy for, do you love what you do? Anyone who loves what they do is inherently intensely curious about their field, their profession, their craft.


They read about it, study it, talk to other people about it… immerse themselves in it, continuously.


One way to test for an aspect of ethics — honesty — is to test for how someone reacts when they don’t know something.


Pick a topic you know intimately and ask the candidate increasingly esoteric questions until they don’t know the answer. They’ll either say they don’t know, or they’ll try to bullshit you. Guess what. If they bullshit you during the hiring process, they’ll bullshit you once they’re onboard.


and make sure everyone has a copy of it, on paper.


Whatever your hiring process is — write it down, and make sure everyone has a copy of it, on paper.


Second, do basic skills tests.


Third, plan out and write down interview questions ahead of time.


Fourth, pay attention to the little things during the interview process.


Fifth, pay attention to the little things during the reference calls.


Sixth, fix your mistakes fast… but not too fast.


Most startups in my experience are undisciplined at fixing hiring mistakes — i.e., firing people who aren’t working out.


First, realize that while you’re going to hate firing someone, you’re going to feel way better after the fact than you can currently imagine.


Second, realize that the great people on your team will be happy that you’ve done it — they knew the person wasn’t working out, and they want to work with other great people, and so they’ll be happy that you’ve done the right thing and kept the average high.


Money talks, hype walks — when you’re hitting your numbers, everyone thinks you’re a genius and believes everything you say, no matter how silly. When you’re not hitting your numbers, everyone thinks you’re a moron and won’t believe anything you say, no matter how true. So go dark, focus on the business, and don’t talk publicly for at least six months.


“focus on opportunities, not problems”,


Frankly, they don’t even have to be consuming that much money. They’re almost certainly consuming time and management bandwidth, and they need to go.


So do it all at once. A company that requires a turnaround has, in all likelihood, hired too many people for the size of the business opportunity it actually has. This impairs profitability, driving away investors and submerging the stock price at precisely the time the company needs a healthy acquisition currency; this demotivates your great people by surrounding them by too many mediocre people and too much bureaucracy; and this slows everything in your company to a crawl because there are simply too many people running around who have to talk about everything before anything gets done.


Companies that have a retention problem usually have a winning problem. Or rather, a “not winning” problem.


Great people want to work at a winner.


Second, focus. In a technology company, focus on retaining the great architects and managers. In other kinds of companies, focus on retaining the equivalent people — the people who are the magnets for retaining other great people and hiring more great people.


Fourth, promote your best people — especially into the jobs vacated by the more senior of the people you just fired — and give them very interesting challenges.


Fifth, simplify and clarify your organizational structure to make sure that your best people have direct responsibility for their projects.


Give your product division heads complete responsibility for everything they need to ship great products — except for sales.


A great general rule of thumb for this kind of organizational redesign is that you want to tolerate overlap. So each product division has its own QA team — so what? Your division heads — who are now your best people — will be able to move so much faster that way that it’s worth it.


And here’s a neat trick that actually works. Go out and re-recruit the best people who already left. Some of them have since discovered that the grass isn’t actually greener at whatever mediocre startup they joined or whatever other big company they jumped to. Give them fat packages against the new mission and get them back.


Eighth, communicate within — tell everyone in your company clearly and unambiguously, we are here to win and here’s how we’re going to do it. It won’t be easy, but we can do it and we will do it, and we will have amazing stories to tell our grandchildren.


You don’t need to be certain of all the answers! Colin Powell says, “You know you’re a good leader when people follow you, if only out of curiosity.” So project boldness, and have that glint in your eye where people know you’re up to something big.


Don’t create a new group or organization within your company whose job is “innovation”. This takes various forms, but it happens reasonably often when a big company gets into product trouble, and it’s hugely damaging.


In general, the intangibles that keep great people are: the quality of the people they’re working with, the interestingness level of their projects, and whether they are learning and growing.


As the leader, you have to really believe that you can get your company back to winning and therefore back to a high stock price. If not, you should sell the company.


Opportunities are key. I would argue that opportunities fall loosely into two buckets: those that present themselves to you, and those that you go out and create. Both will be hugely important to your career.


And they come and go quickly — if you don’t jump all over an opportunity, someone else generally will and it will vanish.


The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.


Which is important, because in life, there is generally no opportunity without risk.


The issue is that without taking risk, you can’t exploit any opportunities.


Finally, pay attention to opportunity cost at all times. Doing one thing means not doing other things. This is a form of risk that is very easy to ignore, to your detriment.


Seize any opportunity, or anything that looks like opportunity. They are rare, much rarer than you think…


Many people do not realize they are getting a lucky break in life when they get it. If a big publisher (or a big art dealer or a movie executive or a hotshot banker or a big thinker) suggests an appointment, cancel anything you have planned: you may not see such a window open up again.


Try very very hard to go to one of the best colleges


Don’t worry about being a small fish in a big pond — you want to always be in the best pond possible, because that’s how you will get exposed to the best people and the best opportunities in your field.


I’m a huge fan of gaining practical experience in school by working during the school year, and then doing as many internships and co-op programs as you can.


The second strategy is fairly easy. Everyone has at least a few areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to understand without living it.


Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable. You make yourself rare by combining two or more “pretty goods” until no one else has your mix…


It sounds like generic advice, but you’d be hard pressed to find any successful person who didn’t have about three skills in the top 25%.


The fact is, this is even the secret formula to becoming a CEO. All successful CEO’s are like this. They are almost never the best product visionaries, or the best salespeople, or the best marketing people, or the best finance people, or even the best managers, but they are top 25% in some set of those skills, and then all of a sudden they’re qualified to actually run something important.


Or even combine two undergrad degrees — computer science plus physics, say, or physics plus economics.


public speakers (top 25%). Anyone can do it with practice. If you add that talent to any other, suddenly you’re the boss of the people who have only one skill… At least one of the skills in your mixture should involve communication, either written or verbal.


The great thing about communication is that most people are terrible at it, because they never take it seriously as a skill to develop.


you can learn communication many other ways, including by doing, by practicing, by taking classes (how about a class in standup comedy? I’m serious!), and


An engineer or a finance person or a lawyer who can communicate is hugely more valuable than one who cannot.


I mean, learn how to convince people that something is in their best interest to do, even when they don’t realize it up front.


Spending a year or more in an actual salesforce can be a superb idea even if you have no intention of making your career in sales. John Doerr once told me that the year he spent “carrying a bag” in sales at Intel in the late 70’s was the most valuable year of his life in terms of skills development —


skills he now uses every day as one of the world’s most successful venture capitalists. If you’ve ever had John Doerr try to talk you


If you’re, for example, a programmer working at a tech company and you don’t know anything about finance, go find a finance person and offer to teach her all about software in return for her teaching you all about finance.


Time spent on the ground in other countries and in other cultures will pay off in many different ways throughout your career.


If your company, or university, offers you the opportunity to spend a year in another country, it’s probably a pretty good idea to take it.


Pick an industry where the founders of the industry — the founders of the important companies in the industry — are still alive and actively involved.


If you are young and want to have an impact, you want to be in an industry where there is a lot of growth and change and flux and opportunity.


As an industry ages, the vitality drains out until all that’s left is a set of ossified remnants in the form of oligopolostic entities of which you would find being a part to be completely soul-killing.


Once you have picked an industry, get right to the center of it as fast as you possibly can. Your target is the core of change and opportunity — figure out where the action is and head there, and do not delay your progress for extraneous opportunities, no matter how lucrative they might be.


Never worry about being a small fish in a big pond. Being a big fish in a small pond sucks — you will hit the ceiling on what you can achieve quickly, and nobody will care. Optimize at all times for being in the most dynamic and exciting pond you can find. That is where the great opportunities can be found.


Or, if you are going to join a startup or start your own company, always make sure that your startup is aimed at the largest and most interesting opportunity available — the new markets that are growing fast and changing rapidly.


Also apply this rule when selecting which city to live in. Go to the city where all the action is happening.


Either way, to quote Pink Floyd, “set the controls for the heart of the sun” — be sure you’re heading where the action is, where the biggest opportunities in your field are, as you’ve chosen to think about it. Don’t fart around in second and third tier companies that don’t have a clear mission to dominate their markets.


In a rapidly changing field like technology, the best place to get experience when you’re starting out is in younger, high-growth companies.


Then, once you’ve racked up killer skills and experiences at a high-growth company, feel free to go to a startup.


Picking which startup to join probably deserves its own post. However, in a nutshell, look for one where you understand the product, see how it might fit into a very large market, and really like and respect the people who are already there.


Don’t keep a schedule


By not keeping a schedule, I mean: refuse to commit to meetings, appointments, or activities at any set time in any future day.


As a result, you can always work on whatever is most important or most interesting, at any time.


But if you can do it, it’s really liberating, and will lead to far higher productivity than almost any other tactic you can try.


you will know that there is nothing more liberating than looking at your calendar and seeing nothing but free time for weeks ahead to work on the most important things in whatever order you want.


Keep three and only three lists: a Todo List, a Watch List, and a Later List.


Each night before you go to bed, prepare a 3×5 index card with a short list of 3 to 5 things that you will do the next day.


Then, throughout the rest of the day, use the back of the 3×5 card as your Anti-Todo List.


The gist of Structured Procrastination is that you should never fight the tendency to procrastinate — instead, you should use it to your advantage in order to get other things done.


The best way to to make sure that you are never asked to do something again is to royally screw it up the first time you are asked to do it.


Do email exactly twice a day — say, once first thing in the morning, and once at the end of the workday. Allocated half an hour or whatever it takes, but otherwise, keep your email client shut and your email notifications turned off.


Only doing email twice a day will make you far more productive for the rest of the day.


The problem with email is that getting an email triggers that same endorphin hit I mentioned above — the one that a mouse gets when he bonks on the button in the cage and gets a food pellet. Responding to an email triggers that same hit.


So you sit and work with your mail client open and you interrupt your work every time an email comes in and you answer it and you send another email and you feel great in the moment.


But what you’re really doing is fracturing your time, interrupting your flow, and killing your ability to focus on anything long enough to get real high-quality work done.


First, always finish each of your two daily email sessions with a completely empty inbox. I don’t know about you, but when I know I have emails in my inbox that haven’t been dealt with, I find it hard to concentrate on other things.


People, for some reason, feel much worse interrupting you if you are wearing headphones than if you’re not.


It’s great — a lot of the time, people will walk up to you, start to say something, notice the headphones, apologize (using exaggerated mouth motions), and walk away.


First, it fuels you up. Study after study have shown that breakfast is, yes, the most important meal of the day. It’s critical to properly fuel the body for the day’s activities and it’s also critical to staying lean or losing weight. (People who don’t have breakfast tend to eat more, and worse, at lunch.)


Only agree to new commitments when both your head and your heart say yes


And I also can’t tell you how often I’ve had a huge, highly-structured todo list in front of me with 100 things on it and I stare at it and am paralyzed into inaction (or, more likely, structured procrastination).


I think it was Andy Grove who said that for every goal you put in front of someone, you should also put in place a counter-goal to restrict gaming of the first goal.


So, for example, if you are incenting your recruiters on the number of new employees recruited and hired, you need to also give them a counter-goal (and tie it to their compensation) that measures the quality of the new hires three months in. Otherwise the recruiters are guaranteed to give you what you don’t want: a lot of mediocre new hires.


Even engineers need counter-goals: incent engineers based purely on a ship date, and you’ll get a shipping product with lots of bugs. Incent based on number of bugs fixed, and you’ll never get any new features. And so on.


if everyone agrees right up front that whatever you are doing makes total sense, it probably isn’t a new and radical enough idea to justify a new company.


First, I believe startups often overfocus on their competitors. It’s the easiest thing in the world to orient yourself in opposition to another company in the same market, and to plan your actions based on what will cause damage to the competitor or block the competitor from getting business.





I think it’s much better for a startup to focus on creating and developing a large market, as opposed to fighting over a small market.


This is probably a good one for entrepreneurs. You’d better not have a lot of doubts about what you are doing because everyone else will, and if you do too, you’ll probably give up.


I think this is something that every entrepreneur needs to watch very carefully. Sometimes it’s simply a matter of timing — and if people just aren’t ready for a new idea, you usually can’t make them ready, and you have to wait for them to change or for a new generation of customers to come along.


The only important thing I can think to add — aside from the importance of hiring curious people — is that lack of curiosity can be a huge danger to a startup in the following way: often, your initial strategy won’t quite work, but you can learn as you go based on other things that happen in the market and eventually iterate into a strategy that does work. Obviously, insufficient curiosity can prevent you from seeing the new data and lead you to continue to pursue a losing strategy even when you wouldn’t have to.


Quality of output does not vary by age… which means, of course, that attempting to improve your batting average of hits versus misses is a waste of time as you progress through a creative career. Instead you should just focus on more at-bats — more output. Think about that one. If this sounds insane to you, Dr. Simonton points out that the periods of Beethoven’s career that had the most hits also had the most misses — works that you never hear.


The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time. The periods of one’s career with the most hits will also have the most misses. So


The odds of a hit versus a miss do not increase over time. The periods of one’s career with the most hits will also have the most misses. So maximizing quantity — taking more swings at the bat — is much higher payoff than trying to improve one’s batting average.


value I place on curiosity — and specifically, curiosity over intelligence. This is why.
