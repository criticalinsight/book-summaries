If you write a big plan, you’ll most likely never look at it anyway. Plans more than a few pages long just wind up as fossils in your file cabinet.


Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier.


Don’t be insecure about aiming to be a small business. Anyone who runs a business that’s sustainable and profitable, whether it’s big or small, should be proud.


In the end, workaholics don’t actually accomplish more than nonworkaholics. They may claim to be perfectionists, but that just means they’re wasting time fixating on inconsequential details instead of moving on to the next task.


You just need an idea, a touch of confidence, and a push to get started.


If you’re going to do something, do something that matters.


The easiest, most straightforward way to create a great product or service is to make something you want to use.


When you solve your own problem, the light comes on. You know exactly what the right answer is.


Best of all, this “solve your own problem” approach lets you fall in love with what you’re making.


What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.


Besides, the perfect time never arrives. You’re always too young or old or busy or broke or something else.


Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service.


If no one’s upset by what you’re saying, you’re probably not pushing hard enough.


A business without a path to profit isn’t a business, it’s a hobby.


Actual businesses worry about profit from day one. Actual businesses don’t mask deep problems by saying, “It’s OK, we’re a startup.”


You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy.


Huge organizations can take years to pivot. They talk instead of act. They meet instead of do.


Southwest—unlike most other airlines, which fly multiple aircraft models—flies only Boeing 737s. As


So start chopping. Getting to great starts by cutting out stuff that’s merely good.


There’s the stuff you could do, the stuff you want to do, and the stuff you have to do. The stuff you have to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter.


Don’t wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward.


When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale. Decisions are progress.


So constantly look for things to remove, simplify, and streamline. Be a curator.


If you start pushing back deadlines and increasing your budget, you’ll never stop.


In business, too many people obsess over tools, software tricks, scaling issues, fancy office space, lavish furniture, and other frivolities instead of what really matters. And what really matters is how to actually get customers and make money.


Once your product does what it needs to do, get it out there.


If you had to launch your business in two weeks, what would you cut out?


This approach just recognizes that the best way to get there is through iterations. Stop


Also, don’t be timid about your conclusions. Sometimes abandoning what you’re working on is the right move, even if you’ve already put in a lot of effort. Don’t throw good time after bad work.


Instead, you should get in the alone zone. Long stretches of alone time are when you’re most productive.


Your alone zone doesn’t have to be in the wee hours, though. You can set up a rule at work that half the day is set aside for alone time. Decree that from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., people can’t talk to each other (except during lunch).


The worst interruptions of all are meetings.


Let’s say you’re going to schedule a meeting that lasts one hour, and you invite ten people to attend. That’s actually a ten-hour meeting, not a one-hour meeting.


Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.


You just build something that gets the job done and then move on.


When good enough gets the job done, go for it.


And remember, you can usually turn good enough into great later.


The way you build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on to the next thing.


To keep your momentum and motivation up, get in the habit of accomplishing small victories along the way. Even


The quicker it’s in the hands of customers, the better off you’ll be.


Keep in mind that the obvious solution might very well be quitting. People automatically associate quitting with failure, but sometimes that’s exactly what you should do.


If you already spent too much time on something that wasn’t worth it, walk away. You can’t get that time back. The worst thing you can do now is waste even more time.


The solution: Break the big thing into smaller things. The smaller it is, the easier it is to estimate. You’re probably still going to get it wrong, but you’ll be a lot less wrong than if you estimated a big project.


And a quick suggestion about prioritization: Don’t prioritize with numbers or labels. Avoid saying, “This is high priority, this is low priority.” Likewise, don’t say, “This is a three, this is a two, this is a one, this is a three,” etc. Do that and you’ll almost always end up with a ton of really high-priority things. That’s not really prioritizing. Instead, prioritize visually. Put the most important thing at the top. When you’re done with that, the next thing on the list becomes the next most important thing. That way you’ll only have a single next most important thing to do at a time. And that’s enough.


The copycat doesn’t really know why something looks the way it looks or feels the way it feels or reads the way it reads.


Be influenced, but don’t steal.


Make you part of your product or service. Inject what’s unique about the way you think into what you sell. Decommoditize your product. Make it something no one else can offer.


But Zappos sets itself apart by injecting CEO Tony Hsieh’s obsession with customer service into everything it does.


Pour yourself into your product and everything around your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the you in your product.


If you think a competitor sucks, say so. When you do that, you’ll find that others who agree with you will rally to your side. Being the anti-______ is a great way to differentiate yourself and attract followers.


So what do you do instead? Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems and leave the hairy, difficult, nasty problems to the competition.


Don’t shy away from the fact that your product or service does less. Highlight it. Be proud of it. Sell it as aggressively as competitors sell their extensive feature lists.


If you’re planning to build “the iPod killer” or “the next Pokemon,” you’re already dead.


You’re not going to out-Apple Apple. They’re defining the rules of the game.


Even if you wind up losing, it’s better to go down fighting for what you believe in instead of just imitating others.


But if a few persnickety patrons tell you to add bananas to your lasagna, you’re going to turn them down, and that’s OK.


Making a few vocal customers happy isn’t worth it if it ruins the product for everyone else.


Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You’re the one who has to believe in it most. That way, you can say, “I think you’ll love it because I love it.”


When you let customers outgrow you, you’ll most likely wind up with a product that’s basic—and that’s fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There’s an endless supply of customers who need exactly that.


And there are always more people who are not using your product than people who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board. That’s where your continued growth potential lies.


People and situations change. You can’t be everything to everyone.


Bad move. The enthusiasm you have for a new idea is not an accurate indicator of its true worth.


So let your latest grand ideas cool off for a while first. By all means, have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don’t act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind.


Being obscure is a great position to be in.


No one knows you, so it’s no big deal if you mess up. Obscurity helps protect your ego and preserve your confidence.


All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. But the most fortunate companies have audiences. An audience can be your secret weapon.


Over the past ten years, we’ve built an audience of more than a hundred thousand daily readers for our Signal vs. Noise blog.


Every day they come back to see what we have to say.


So build an audience. Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos—whatever. Share information that’s valuable and you’ll slowly but surely build a loyal audience.


Instead of trying to outspend, outsell, or outsponsor competitors, try to out-teach them. Teaching probably isn’t something your competitors are even thinking about.


Teaching is something individuals and small companies can do that bigger competitors can’t.


So why do you know these few better than others? Because they share everything they know.


Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive.


Don’t be afraid of sharing.


People are curious about how things are made.


They want to know how and why other people make decisions.


Letting people behind the curtain changes your relationship with them. They’ll feel a bond with you and see you as human beings instead of a faceless company.


When something becomes too polished, it loses its soul. It seems robotic.


So talk like you really talk. Reveal things that others are unwilling to discuss. Be upfront about your shortcomings.


contact the journalist who wrote it. Pitch her with some passion, some interest, some life. Do something meaningful. Be remarkable. Stand out. Be unforgettable.


You want an easily digestible introduction to what you sell. This gives people a way to try it without investing any money or a lot of time.


Don’t be afraid to give a little away for free—as long as you’ve got something else to sell.


Do you have a marketing department? If not, good.


If you do, don’t think these are the only people responsible for marketing. Accounting is a department. Marketing isn’t. Marketing is something everyone in your company is doing 24/7/365.


Recognize that all of these little things are more important than choosing which piece of swag to throw into a conference goodie bag.


Marketing isn’t just a few individual events. It’s the sum total of everything you do.


You will not be a big hit right away. You will not get rich quick. You are not so special that everyone else will instantly pay attention. No one cares about you. At least not yet. Get used to it.


You know those overnight-success stories you’ve heard about? It’s not the whole story.


Dig deeper and you’ll usually find people who have busted their asses for years to get into a position where things could take off.


Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth. It’s hard, but you have to be patient. You have to grind it out. You have to do it for a long time before the right people notice.


And remember, great brands launch without PR campaigns all the time.


Start building your audience today. Start getting people interested in what you have to say. And then keep at it. In a few years, you too will get to chuckle when people discuss your “overnight” success.


NEVER HIRE ANYONE to do a job until you’ve tried to do it yourself first. That way, you’ll understand the nature of the work.


You’ll also be a much better manager, because you’ll be supervising people who are doing a job you’ve done before.


Don’t hire for pleasure; hire to kill pain.


Similarly, if you lose someone, don’t replace him immediately. See how long you can get by without that person and that position.


The right time to hire is when there’s more work than you can handle for a sustained period of time.


Problems start when you have more people than you need. You start inventing work to keep everyone busy. Artificial work leads to artificial projects. And those artificial projects lead to real costs and complexity.


Great has nothing to do with it. If you don’t need someone, you don’t need someone.


Hire a ton of people rapidly and a “strangers at a cocktail party” problem is exactly what you end up with. There are always new faces around, so everyone is unfailingly polite. Everyone tries to avoid any conflict or drama. No one says, “This idea sucks.” People appease instead of challenge.


They don’t care about landing your job; they just care about landing any job. If someone sends out a resumé to three hundred companies, that’s a huge red flag right there.


On the other hand, if your gut is telling you there’s a chance at a real match, then move on to the interview stage.


But after that, the curve flattens out. There’s surprisingly little difference between a candidate with six months of experience and one with six years. The real difference comes from the individual’s dedication, personality, and intelligence.


How long someone’s been doing it is overrated. What matters is how well they’ve been doing it.


Consider dropouts, people who had low GPAs, community-college students, and even those who just went to high school.


With a small team, you need people who are going to do work, not delegate work. Everyone’s got to be producing. No one can be above the work.


That means you need to avoid hiring delegators, those people who love telling others what to do. Delegators are dead weight for a small team. They clog the pipes for others by coming up with busywork. And when they run out of work to assign, they make up more—regardless of whether it needs to be done.


Hire managers of one Managers of one are people who come up with their own goals and execute them. They don’t need heavy direction. They don’t need daily check-ins. They do what a manager would do—set the tone, assign items, determine what needs to get done, etc.—but they do it by themselves and for themselves. These people free you from oversight. They set their own direction. When you leave them alone, they surprise you with how much they’ve gotten done. They don’t need a lot of hand-holding or supervision. How can you spot these people? Look at their backgrounds. They have set the tone for how they’ve worked at other jobs. They’ve run something on their own or launched some kind of project. You want someone who’s capable of building something from scratch and seeing it through. Finding these people frees the rest of your team to work more and manage less.


Had we limited our search only to people in Chicago, we would have missed out on half of the great people we have.


To make sure your remote team stays in touch, have at least a few hours a day of real-time overlap.


Two to four hours of overlap should be plenty.


Geography just doesn’t matter anymore. Hire the best talent, regardless of where it is.


The best way to do that is to actually see them work. Hire them for a miniproject, even if it’s for just twenty or forty hours. You’ll see how they make decisions. You’ll see if you get along. You’ll see what kind of questions they ask. You’ll get to judge them by their actions instead of just their words.


When something bad happens, tell your customers (even if they never noticed in the first place).


People will respect you more if you are open, honest, public, and responsive during a crisis.


Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service.


The number-one principle to keep in mind when you apologize: How would you feel about the apology if you were on the other end? If


Keep in mind that you can’t apologize your way out of being an ass. Even the best apology won’t rescue you if you haven’t earned people’s trust.


The more people you have between your customers’ words and the people doing the work, the more likely it is that the message will get lost or distorted along the way.


Everyone on your team should be connected to your customers—maybe not every day, but at least a few times throughout the year.


That’s the only way your team is going to feel the hurt your customers are experiencing.


Craigslist founder Craig Newmark still answers support e-mails today (often within minutes).


Passions flare in the beginning. That’s normal. But if you ride out that first rocky week, things usually settle down.


People are creatures of habit. That’s why they react to change in such a negative way. They’re used to using something in a certain way and any change upsets the natural order of things. So they push back. They complain. They demand that you revert to the way things were.


Sometimes you need to go ahead with a decision you believe in, even if it’s unpopular at first.


Also, remember that negative reactions are almost always louder and more passionate than positive ones. In fact, you may hear only negative voices even when the majority of your customers are happy about a change.


So when people complain, let things simmer for a while. Let them know you’re listening. Show them you’re aware of what they’re saying. Let them know you understand their discontent. But explain that you’re going to let it go for a while and see what happens. You’ll probably find that people will adjust eventually. They may even wind up liking the change more than the old way, once they get used to it.


You don’t create a culture. It happens. This is why new companies don’t have a culture. Culture is the by-product of consistent behavior.


Culture is action, not words.


Decisions are temporary “But what if . . . ?” “What happens when . . . ?” “Don’t we need to plan for . . . ?” Don’t make up problems you don’t have yet. It’s not a problem until it’s a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.


Besides, the decisions you make today don’t need to last forever. It’s easy to shoot down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It’s just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change.


At this stage, it’s silly to worry about whether or not your concept will scale from five to five thousand people (or from a hundred thousand to 100 million people). Getting a product or service off the ground is hard enough without inventing even more obstacles. Optimize for now and worry about the future later.


The ability to change course is one of the big advantages of being small. Compared with larger competitors, you’re way more capable of making quick, sweeping changes. Big companies just can’t move that fast. So pay attention to today and worry about later when it gets here. Otherwise you’ll waste energy, time, and money fixating on problems that may never materialize.


The environment has a lot more to do with great work than most people realize.


This isn’t about casual Fridays or bring-your-dog-to-work day. (If those are such good things, then why aren’t you doing them every day of the week?)


Rockstar environments develop out of trust, autonomy, and responsibility. They’re a result of giving people the privacy, workspace, and tools they deserve. Great environments show respect for the people who do the work and how they do it.


When you treat people like children, you get children’s work. Yet that’s exactly how a lot of companies and managers treat their employees. Employees need to ask permission before they can do anything. They need to get approval for every tiny expenditure. It’s surprising they don’t have to get a hall pass to go take a shit.


When everything constantly needs approval, you create a culture of nonthinkers. You create a boss-versus-worker relationship that screams, “I don’t trust you.”


And look, you’re not going to get a full eight hours a day out of people anyway. That’s a myth. They might be at the office for eight hours, but they’re not actually working eight hours. People need diversions. It helps disrupt the monotony of the workday. A little YouTube or Facebook time never hurt anyone.


You don’t need more hours; you need better hours.


When people have something to do at home, they get down to business. They get their work done at the office because they have somewhere else to be. They find ways to be more efficient because they have to. They need to pick up the kids or get to choir practice. So they use their time wisely.


As the saying goes, “If you want something done, ask the busiest person you know.” You want busy people. People who have a life outside of work. People who care about more than one thing.


So don’t scar on the first cut. Don’t create a policy because one person did something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over again.


There’s nothing wrong with sounding your own size. Being honest about who you are is smart business, too. Language is often your first impression—why start it off with a lie? Don’t be afraid to be you.


Talk to customers the way you would to friends. Explain things as if you were sitting next to them.


Avoid jargon or any sort of corporate-speak. Stay away from buzzwords when normal words will do just fine. Don’t talk about “monetization” or being “transparent”; talk about making money and being honest. Don’t use seven words when four will do.


Write to be read, don’t write just to write. Whenever you write something, read it out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, how can you make it more conversational?


Who said writing needs to be formal? Who said you have to strip away your personality when putting words on paper? Forget rules. Communicate!


And when you’re writing, don’t think about all the people who may read your words. Think of one person. Then write for that one person. Writing for a mob leads to generalities and awkwardness. When you write to a specific target, you’re a lot more likely to hit the mark.


They’re not fuck or shit. They’re need, must, can’t, easy, just, only, and fast. These words get in the way of healthy communication. They are red flags that introduce animosity, torpedo good discussions, and cause projects to be late.


(and also watch out for their cousins: everyone, no one, always, and never).


When you turn into one of these people who adds ASAP to the end of every request, you’re saying everything is high priority. And when everything is high priority, nothing is. (Funny how everything is a top priority until you actually have to prioritize things.)


ASAP is inflationary.


Most things just don’t warrant that kind of hysteria. If a task doesn’t get done this very instant, nobody is going to die. Nobody’s going to lose their job. It won’t cost the company a ton of money. What it will do is create artificial stress, which leads to burnout and worse.


So reserve your use of emergency language for true emergencies. The kind where there are direct, measurable consequences to inaction. For everything else, chill out.


WE ALL HAVE ideas. Ideas are immortal. They last forever. What doesn’t last forever is inspiration. Inspiration is like fresh fruit or milk: It has an expiration


date.


If you want to do something, you’ve got to do it now. You can’t put it on a shelf and wait two months to get around to it. You can’t just say you’ll do it later. Later, you won’t be pumped up about it anymore.


If you’re inspired on a Friday, swear off the weekend and dive into the project. When you’re high on inspiration, you can get two weeks of work done in twenty-four hours. Inspiration is a time machine in that way. Inspiration is a magical thing, a productivity multiplier, a motivator. But it won’t wait for you. Inspiration is a now thing. If it grabs you, grab it right back and put it to work.
