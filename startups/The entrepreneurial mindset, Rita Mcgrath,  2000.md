## Chapter 3 Product Redesign (Blockbuster Product Design) 
#1 read/books/startup#

The simplest way to change a business model is to redesign your offerings (products and services) What you should be aiming for is a blockbuster design - on that so appeals to your target customers that they feel almost compelled to buy from you. 

The essence of the idea is to discover a bundle of features that your customers perceive to be worth a lot more than the price you are going to extract from them, as well as a lot more than the competitors are offering. 

Trying to achieve perfection is a mistake because the translation from what your business has to offer to what the customer wants or needs can never be perfect. Although some features will attract and please customers, creating a positive reaction, others will be tolerated only because the benefits of the positive attributes exceeds the inconveniences of the negatives. Negative features are unavoidable. These may have to do with some risk or inconvenience associated with the product or service, or they may be source of simple dislike. The most obvious negative attribute, of course, is price. Sine buying decisions are seldom made on the basis of one or two features but reflect a complex mix of trade-offs, your job is to grasp the essence of how customers make trade-offs and to use this knowledge to influence product and service design.

# Attribute Map
A simple mapping process gives you a start on capturing how well your product or service is appealing to customer’s needs at the moment. *The simples way to get started is to identify an offering and an important customer segment for that offering.* Prepare one map per segment per product.

*Positive customer attributes:* are those the customer likes. *Negative customer attributes:* are those features that the targeted customer segment dislikes and would rather do without. *Neutral customer attributes:* are those that the customer simply doesn’t care about at all

*Basic feature:* customer they take it for grated that any competitor could offer it. 
*Discriminating feature:* attributes that cause customers to judge your firm to be superior or inferior to competitors. 
*Energising features:*  are attributes that customers consider overwhelmingly positive or negative and that dominate the purchasing decision.

## Positive Features on the Attribute Map
Positive features are all good to have. Customers with positive attitudes toward your offering will tend to buy more, remain more loyal, and sometimes even be prepared to pay price premiums. 

*Nonnegotiable’s (Positive/Basic):* a basic positive feature is regarded by your segment as something you should provide as a matter of course.  If you fail to offer it, the segment will abandon you.  In most developed industries, the list of nonnegotiable can be long. In automobile industry we take for granted hundreds of features on our cars, from easy starting, to air conditioning, built-in radio, and CD player, safety features etc. *The problem with basic features is that they don’t generate profits.* 

*Differentiators (Positive/Discriminating):* Differentiators are attributes that distinguish your offering from your competitors’ in a positive way. In autos, for instance, Volvo has long differentiated its car on the basis of safety. Volvos are laden with safety-enhancing features, extending to the heavy, reinforced car bodies for which Volvo historically was lampooned. For Volvo’s traditional target segment, owning a crash-resistant car was worth trading off the fuel economy and sporty looks that other segments might prefer. Now, of course, Volvo has introduced its own sportier-looking (but still safe) cars, and other firms (such as Saab and Audi) have taken up the safety mantra.

*Exciters (Positive/Energising):* Attributes that so delight the customer that they constitute the overwhelming reason for making a purchase are called exciters. _Exciters are often technically simple, relatively low-cost advances that greatly add to the offering’s convenience or ease of use._ Nokia found that customers get excited not about the complex technology inside the phones, but about how the phones look and what external features they have, like replaceable covers that match the customer’s clothing, suit the season. Honda, which introduced the cup holder as a standard feature in 1988, credits this feature and similar innovations with making its car the best-selling in the US for more than half a decade. Given little else to differentiate cars in its class, a person may think, why not buy the Honda with the cup holder? Thus entered one of automobile history’s most surprisingly potent innovations. For many segments in the US, cup holders rapidly migrated from being an exciter, a feature that dramatically and positively influenced customer’s perception of value for Honda alone, to being a nonnegotiable basic feature of most cars. Be aware of this predictable dynamic of exciter features: *As competitors realise how much customers want the feature, they will copy it* (See example with Facebook and Snapchat. When Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp copied the stories feature) . What can happen after all the relevant competitors have adopted the feature is that no one is any better off in terms of competitive positions, but the whole cost structure of the industry is increased as a result of having to offer the now nonnegotiable feature. 

## Negative Features on the Attribute Map
Unfortunately, you don’t have the option of avoiding negative attributes completely. Being conscious of them is crucial. A great source of opportunity for your business can be negatives that your competitors have failed to address. Fix it, and you’ll have an edge over the competition. All negatives are a potential source of entrepreneurial opportunity, particularly when your competitors focus on working the positive line. Adding value by creating more positive features and bulking up the product with enhancements are popular endeavours, whereas opportunities created by reducing negatives are ofter overlooked. Compaq created Presario (Notebook) without no fussing with cables, no irritating fiddling with disks to load software, no anxiety-producing and incomprehensible DOS prompts. *People who come in direct contact with customers or distributors have the most insights into the negatives such as your customers see them. Staff in sales, service, complaint handling, returns processing, call centres, and account receivable are all likely to be exposed to customers who see your product in their worst possible light.*

*Tolerable’s (Negative/Basics):* are attributes that customers are wiling to put up with, even through they don’t like them. Many entrepreneurs have made their money by eliminating negatives that were ignored by other providers. Charles Brewer, for instance, founded the high-quality Internet service provider (ISP) Mindspring (market cap. 1,6$B) in response to a negative experience he had trying to access the Internet. Its management team credits this success to their commitment to operating without the infuriating lapses in services that other ISPs expect customers to tolerate.  Some examples for tolerable’s are industries such as mining, energy, chemicals, forest products, that create massive tolerable int he form of environmentally damaging products. 

*Dissatisfies (Negative/Discriminating):* It is important to be self-critical of one’s own tolerable, because technological advances and competitor’s creativity can quickly turn them into dissatisfiers. As soon as customers can be made to believe that they can avoid dealing with a negative attribute of your offering by buying c competitor’s, that attribute is no longer a tolerable; it becomes a dissatisfier. *Dissatisfiers are features that differentiate you from your competitors, but in the wrong direction.* In the 1970s Japanese auto manufactureers in the US created new categories of dissatisfiers from the US policy of planned obsolescence. For decades, buyers of US cars routinely put up with frequent repair and service visits. High-quality Japanese cars, however, needed attention far less often and where much more reliable than the US counterparts. With surprising rapidity, the service-intensive requirements of US cars that had been tolerated for years became deeply dissatisfying. 
Dissatisfiers act to segment your customers by causing some to reject your offering and seek those of competitors. Dissatisfiers can build up slowly then take hold fast. 

*Enragers (Negative/Energizing):* Even more deadly to your competitive position is a class of attributes that are energising, but negative. They have many other negative emotions, ranging from fear to disgust. Enragers can be the result of misfortune, such as the Tylenol cyanide poisoning in 1982, Valujet’s plane crash in the Everglades in 1996, and the contamination of Perrier water with benzene in 1990 or the flaw in the Intel’s Pentium chip. If you are unfortunate enough to have to deal with an attribute that becomes an enrager (or source of terror or disgust), it is critical to eliminate it, or you will lose the affected customer segment for good. The reputation of the highly publicised problem of benzene contamination that it has never recovered. Perrier, which enjoyed upward of 44 percent of the US market for bottled water in 1990, is now struggling at half that share in the face of vicious competition.  If you cannot eliminate an enrager, you may have to leave the enraged target market. 

## Neutral Features on the Attribute Map
Neutral responses to product or service offerings can be classified as so whats? or parallels. These attributes do not affect the purchasing decision of most customers or do so in a way not directly related to the offering. 

*“So Whats?” (Neutral/Basic):*  Attributes that elicit a “so what?” response from customers are sometimes legacies from the past. Consider Microsoft products they include many functions that many customers don’t use. Consider the extensive features available for Word-Perfect users in Microsoft’s Word program. Designed to help WordPerfect users convert to Word, this whole set of features is a “so what?” for anyone who started off with Word. Sometimes, incorporating a neutral attribute in a product can actually generate negative responses. For instance, in order to provide all the functionality that many users segments desire, Microsoft’s programs also include negatives for virtually all customers.  For example it takes to start up and shot down windows-based computer because by the voluminous amount of hard disk space that Windows soaks up, much of which is driven by the need to support functionality we probably will never use. 
By eliminating the “so what?” attributes companies can lower the costs. More subtle and more dangerous than outright “so whats?” on the neutral line are “nice to have” attributes. These are features that may differentiate your offering from those of competitors but that most customers will no be prepared to pay for. If a small set of customers beguiles you into offering these attributes, you may find yourself adding significantly to costs without gaining in profits. 

*Parallels (Neutral/Discriminating):* are features that are offered in parallel with the primary attributes of your product or service, but that seemingly have little to do with its function or purpose. For example, frequent-flier miles have nothing to do with the price of a ticket, the time of departure, the comfort and convenience of the flight, or the safety of the airline, but woe betide the airline today that does not offer miles in parallel with its flight. 

*The point of attribute mapping is to provide a simple powerful process for redesigning a given offering for a given customer segment. The redesign process works best when it incorporates these elements: mapping attributes, checking assumptions about customer attitudes, prioritising actions, capturing opportunities (see “Setting Up an Opportunity Register”)*

### Matting Attributes Process:
Start with employees in your search for redesign opportunities. Begin by filling in an attribute matrix with people who regularly interact with customers: the service force, complaint department, application acceptance people, accounts payable staff, salespeople, technical support personnel and their like often have great insight into customer thinking. *The idea is to have one map per product per segment*

## Case Study with Progressive Insurance of Ohio
An example of a company that did just that is Progressive Insurance of Ohio, which created a blockbuster service package for its portfolio of “nonstandard” auto drivers, who don’t fit the profile of conventional policy holders. Many of these nonstandard drivers are well-off, but short of time. Conventionally, auto insurance providers have divided their customers into two segments: standard and nonstandard (higher risks: young, poor claims history, points on their licence, or driving record with alcohol, also a group with luxury cars). Most of the companies consider the nonstandard type of driver to be unprofitable.  Progressive Insurance of Ohio, in contrast, decided to specialise in serving. the time-sensitive and less price-sensitive part of this market and created a blockbuster offering for owners of expensive luxury cars; *the offering is summed up in attribute terms in figure 3-4.*  Because drivers in this segment are time stressed and their repairs are expensive, the company reasoned, they need to be processed quickly by the company’s claims operations, including the assessment, adjustment, repair and claims-processing services. Progressive consequently focused on streamlining and improving the claims operations experience for such customers. Among the changes Progressive made were to institute a twenty-four-four immediate-response accident hot line and highly responsive claims management.

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-07%20at%2012.21.37.png)



![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-07%20at%2012.25.54.png)
![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-07%20at%2012.25.31.png)

One of this offering’s most innovative feature is its adjustment office on wheels. Using a van equipped with telephone, fax and other office equipment, the mobile claims adjuster is authorised to go to the site of an accident and settle the claim on the spot.  Contrast this with the usual tortuous process of having the damage assessed, waiting to see the bill, and arguing with various parties about who owes what to whom. Moreover Progressive carries the process through to closure by providing recommendations on services such as repairs and towing. 

Progressive’s customers segment is made up of people who value convenience over price. They are actively looking for a provider and are often quite angry and upset with their traditional provider. This realisation prompted Progressive to create a range of channels through which such customers could find the company-including TV, direct-mail, an “express quote” service that provides insurance quotes over the telephone and on the Internet.  

### Checking the Assumptions
Your completed attribute maps represent your team’s best assumptions about the customer’s attitude towards your offering and the extent to which the offering satisfy customer needs. Unfortunately, assumptions are only as good as the data on which they are based. A vitally important part of redesigning an offering is testing the assumptions by involving the customer. You can do this with focus groups, face-to-face interviews, and even customer groups who complete attribute maps from their point of view. Any of the preceding will help you connect with your customer’s perception of your offering.  *Be aware that it is all too easy to get feedback from your most demanding or most accommodating customers.* The problem is that they may be totally unrepresentative of the vast majority of segments to which you wish to appeal.  PC makers have battled with this challenge for years - the early adopters of PCs tended to be very comfortable with computers and tolerant of their quirks. The mass market, however, consists of customers who want an easy-to-use, cheap machine that delivers on what they consider the most important functions-access to the Internet and the ability to manage basic applications and games, for instance. The high-end segment will give you a poor representation of the attributes likely to make a blockbuster offering for the mass market. *Ask new customers or people who don’t use something what to remove and ask early adopters or highly engaged customers, which features to improve.*

### Prioritising Actions
1. Easy-to-accomplish, inexpensive moves can be put in place right away. At Continental Airlines, for instance, employees came up with the idea of putting a priority tag on the luggage of high marketing or high-volume customers; as the plane is unloaded, these tagged bags get put on the first cart going back to the terminal and arrive the luggage area first. The simple and inexpensive ideas has found great favour with Continental’s most desired customer set, the relatively price-insensitive but time-sensitive business traveler. 
2. One you’ve checked your assumptions on customer attitude and determined what attributes require attention, you should give top priority to attributes that may represent lurking enragers. They must be eliminated, or you will lose critical competitive ground.  One you fix the problem, make sure that you have a communication strategy that widely disseminates this information so that those customers about to abandon the offering are retained and those who have already left might be encouraged to give you another try. 
3. Your next priority is to tend to current and emerging dissatisfiers. These represent areas in which customers perceive your competitiors to be doing a better job, not troublesome areas characteristic of your entire industry. Dissatisfiers may be product features, but they can also be operations- and service-related attributes, such as when your firm takes a substantially longer than the competition to complete a particular transaction. You should try to measure what these improvements are brinings such as more sales to the same customers, better referrals to new customers or deeper penetration into an existing segment. 
4. Having dealt with the attributes that are likely to cause you to lose competitive ground, the next priority is to think about the “so what?” and the nonnegotiable attributes. By removing the non-used “so what?” you can reduce costs. *Note that nonnegotiable must always be provided.*
5. Features that are selectively neutral (some customers care about them while other don’t) can be more difficult to manage. If it is cheaper to simply include the feature for all customers and it doesn’t create negatives for other customer segments, then the attribute can remain in place. If, however the feature is costly to your organisation or if you believe that some customers segments would pay more for it, it may be time to offer it as part of a menu of options.  This can lead to opportunities to profit from features to sell them separately. 
6. With nonnegotiables, which as mentioned above, no longer give you any competitive advantage, your challenge is to think through way in which the expense of delivering the features can be reduced. It is often useful to carefully check out assumptions regarding the nonnegotiable nature of attributes. Companies can easily come to assume that something is a nonnegotiable when for many important segments it is actually neutral and could be eliminated with little damage to customer appeal. 
7. *Having dispensed with negatives and neutrals, you can move on to consider the next generation differentiators and exciters.* The goal is to identify areas in which your distinctive skills and competences can be systematically used or developed to offer new differentiators and exciters and to diminish current dissatisfiers. (Each function in the firm has a strategic role in achieving this goal. Market researchers should be looking for early signs of potential exciters and differentiators and communicating their findings to product and process design engineers.  The marketing staff should estimate the size of various potential customer segments and develop promotional vehicles that will quickly advertise these exciters and differentiators, thereby capitalising on first-mover effects. _Product and design should also be looking at the possibility of eliminating or reducing tolerables that could catapult your offering into a differentiator position while at the same time pushing competitors into a dissatisfier position._)

## Keeping an Eye on Dynamics
The final activity in redesign involves brining the future into current decision making. Some trends are easily predictable. Inevitably, yesterday’s exciting features will become nonnegotiables yesterday’s existing feature will become nonnegotiables as competitors adopt them. Inevitably, some of today’s tolerable features will become dissatisfying. Early in a product life cycle, customers go for new features. As customers learn, competitors imitate, and as the competences improve, customers get used to the features that first excited them and start to look for new attributes. Early calculators pleased customers by doing calculations. Later versions featured built-in memory, improved power supply, and more sophisticated calculations. Today, calculators come in many shapes and sizes and cost so little that simple ones are often given away as promotions. The movement of attributes from new features to reliability to bundled offerings to quality/price competition is a common pattern.  Take the case of Kellog’s Corn Fales as a cautionary tale of missed trends tired attribute set.  From 1990 to 1998, the percentage of all breakfasts consumed in the United States that included cereal dropped from nearly 38 percent to just under 34 percent, even as the company’s share of overall cereal sales in the nation declined from 36 percent to 32 percent. Trends producing this effect are many, including an increase in dual-career households, longer commutes (resulting in people’s wanting breakfast food they can eat in the car), and plethora of alternative breakfast foods. To the delight of bagel makers, drive-through restaurants, and purveyors of handheld food, corn flakes have faded in popularity, and the formerly differentiating properties of cereals (that they are good for you and easy to prepare for instance) are no longer appealing. Further, technological advances have enabled competitors to produce corn flakes at cut-rate prices. 

# Summary of actions
1. Put together a working group of people who come into contact with your most important existing or desired customer segments for a particular product or service offering that you wish to redesign. Describe these segments.
2. Using the group to brainstorm, develop a preliminary attribute map for each of these major customer segments. Sometimes it pays to start with small groups of people form a particular function that involves regular interaction with customers (or distributors)-people in sales, service, or customer relations; telephone operators; order clerks; credit clerks; and so on.  Once you have gone through the mapping procedure with these functional groups, put together a consolidated map for discussion with a group of people that represent all of the functions in your organisation.
3. Validate the assumptions in the working version of the attribute map by taking a reality check with customers and/or customer’s companies (and distributors, if appropriate). Use Kano survey for this purpose if possible. Revise the map.
4. Prioritise the actions suggested by this early analysis. Identify opportunities to do the following: 
	1. Eliminate emerging enragers, if any.
	2. Implement immediate and visible improvements in dissatisfiers.
	3. Carry out cost reduction of nonnegotiables (beginning with the most expensive)
	4. Identify and introduce next-generation exciters and differentiators.
	5. Eliminate neutrals that add no value for any customer set.
5. Record those opportunities you have unearthed in your opportunity register.
6. Identify major trends in customer segments that may present opportunities to redesign an offering. Examples include changes in customer needs or a customer’s no longer having the need, which translates into obsolescence for a particular attribute; emerging new needs; and changes in the size and growth rate of a major market segment. Capture in your opportunity register ideas for future blockbuster design that these trends suggest.
7. Identify major external trends that might pose opportunities or threats. These would include changes in the marketplace, technology, demographics, the regulatory environment, and competitors. Add to the opportunity register any opportunities that arise.

## Chapter 4 Redifferentiating Product and Services 
Next, we consider finding new opportunities for differentiation, meaning ways that yo that you set yourself apart from the competition and that customers perceive as positive. We start with a method we can quizzing, which you can use for developing insights into customer behaviour. 

*We believe that no market is so mature that you cannot further differentiate your offerings, although we hear this lament all the time, particularly from managers in embattled business-to-business industries.*

## Quizzing for Context
It’s surprisingly easy to forget that customers don’t really care about your offerings. What customers care about is their own needs and how to meet them. Understanding the customer’s experiential context (what he feels, what he is worried about, by whom he is influenced) is your key to brining about great differentiation.

To demonstrate how quizzing works, let’s walk through an example of how one very successful entrepreneur differentiated a product that most people would regard as a slow-growth commodity. Our example involves a company called Blyth Industries. Blyth CEO, Bob Goergen, has met with incredible success in manufacturing and marketing - off all things - candles. Goergen is the sort of person we like to study, someone who has perceived and grasped opportunities that were seemingly invisible to other. 
1. Let us first ask what the candle is being used for and where it is being used. Candles can be used for many reasons in different places, for instance, to celebrate or provide light in the home, to provide light and atmosphere in restaurants, to provide light outdoors to express reverence in places of worship and to play homage at vigils. 
2. For each major reason and location, we can probe deeper and ask specifically where at each location candles are used. For example, where in the home are candles used? Some obvious examples include the following locations: dining room, bedroom, basement (near the fuse box), patio, and bathroom. Each of these locations in the home presents different experiential context.  Candles might be wanted to create a festive mood, a romantic mood, a cozy mood, and so on.
3. Consider the dinning room. To get at the context, you might start with who might be with the customer in the dinning room when candles are used. Depending on who these other people are, you might sell very different kinds of candles. For instance, one could be entertaining family, having a neighbourhood party, enjoying a romantic evening with a date, or entertaining business associates. 
4. Let us now focus in on home, dining room, and family and ask when the candles are used? Again there are a number of possible occasions, each with its own connotations. There are, for example, birthdays, anniversaries, holidays, graduations, Valentine’s Days, and job promotions. 

*This process can be repeated over and over again for different types of companions gathering in different rooms*. By thinking through the context and emotional tenor of each situation, you might add value to the candle offering by providing ancillary products (such as different designs, colours, accessories such as potpourris, special-occasion wrappings, party kits, decorations kits). 

Figure 4–2 depicts just three of the many differentiated lines of candles that Bob Goergen’s company has brought to market. The potential for differentiation is limited only by the imagination. As Goergen will telly you, “This industry has been in decline for the past three hundred years!” Yes that didn’t stop Blyth Industries from differentiation and then redifferentiation its products. Goergen launched one new product after another, tailored to the specific locations (where), companions (who), and occasions (when) for which the candles were to be used. The company grew from 3$ million in sales in 1982 as producer of religious candles to nearly $500 million in sales in 1996. Its market value in 1997 was 1.2$ billion. 

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-10%20at%2011.00.19.png)

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-10%20at%2011.00.47.png)

The best opportunities allow you to create differentiation on the basis of skills and capabilities that your business has and that your competitors do not. This makes it difficult for the competitors to match quickly. For Blyth Industries, Goergen used a combination of outstanding market research capabilities coupled with the company’s technical skills at being able to deploy highly sophisticated production techniques to blend candle waxes, colours, and fragrances into shapes and styles that other companies couldn’t match at the same price. 

*There are many ways in which industrial firms have changed the rules of the game by differentiating-not only on the basis of products but also on the basis of the services provided with that product.* For many years, for instance, IBM commanded price premiums for its services, even with plenty of competition. Indeed, the sourcing consultants Mitchell-Madison group found that competitors would have to offer a total cost savings of 15 percent  before their bids would even be entertained by IBM clients.  
If your customers are industrial, the single most important thing you need to do is to understand how they are trying to compete.  To the extent that you understand how they are competing and can help them compete, you have a key differentiator. For instance, a senior executive at LSI Logic pointed out that if you are selling semiconductor arrays to Sony, for which the goal is primarily to be the leading innovator, the appeal is unique features and functionality. Matsushita, on the other hand, is a determined “fast follower,” so it is primarily interested in speed to market and reliability. 

## Consumption Chain Analysis
If looking at usage doesn’t lead to a lot of great ideas, do not despair, there are many more places that you can do this! Enter a second tool that can be used for strategic differentiation: consumption chain analysis.  This works on the premise that opportunities for differentiation lurk at every step of the way your customers take, from the time they first become aware of their needs for your product or service to the time they finally dispose of the remnants of the used product. We call these steps the customer’s consumption chain. 

### Identifying the Links in the Chain
Any link in the consumption chain has differentiation potential-your job is to find out which links are the most promising for your organisation, and why. The first step in doing this is to understand how the chain works.  Figure 4-3 illustrates the typical links in the chain for a manufactured product.

Tip: The process could be different based on the business type, for instance for an agency, there could be something like: Awareness, search, selection, order and purchase, delivering, reporting, recurring payments, service, complains, customer churn or project/end.

1. *Awareness of Need* How do customers become aware of their need for something you can provide, a problem you can solve? If you are a toothbrush manufacturer, your challenge is to persuade massive numbers of consumers not only that brushing their teeth is important but that your particular kind of brush is the one they have to have. Oral B’s managers developed a line of toothbrushes that they called the Indicator line in 1992. The toothbrushes incorporate a patented method of dyeing the centre bristles of the brush blue. When the blue dye has been leached aways, it’s time to change the toothbrush. In effect, the product tells the consumer when it needs to be replaced. This turned out to be a major win. (the same example with Gillette Mach 3). The company benefited by being able to charge premium prices- The Indicator toothbrush sells for about 15 percent more than Oral B’s other brushes, which themselves cost double the price of standard store brushes. The idea of building smart functionality into ordinary products, however, is everywhere. Take batteries, a product category in which demand for portable devices has created booming demand. In 1996, Energizer pioneered the first on-battery tester, a technology that allows consumers to test battery power on the spot, creating an information benefit that people never had before. Hewlett-Packard and other manufacturers of copiers, fax machines, and printers have long incorporated usage information in their products, so that customer can purchase replacement before the ink supply is exhausted. 
2. *Search* How do customers identify alternative solutions? The key objective here is to increate product visibility. Making the customer’s search easy, positioning your offerings where he or she i likely to find them, finding occasions for purchase when customers simply don’t want to be bothered doing a lot of comparison shopping, these are all ways to capitalise on differentiation in the search process. For instance, rather than offering a product or service and setting the price, Priceline.com has the customer set the price and looks for vendors willing to sell for that amount.
3. *Selection* Why does a customer pick one solution over another? Consider the purchase of a sued car over experience fraught with bad publicity and, other, bad previous experience (Example from 2001). Companies like CarMay offer customer the opportunity to use computers to scroll through detailed descriptions of cars for sale on the lot.  A nonnegotiable price is listed. It is now entirely possible for a consumer to specify what car he or she is looking for, what price range, and what geographic location, and subsequently find a ready seller, for virtually no investment of time or energy.  
4. *Order and Purchase* What must a customer do to buy from you? Surprising thorough it might seem, many companies are successful at interesting the customer and persuading them to select their product, only to lose the game at the point of sale. Many companies on the internet are guilty of making the most difficult part of the process the actual purchase of a good or service, by requiring time-consuming entry of customer information, and often multiple, slow-to-load validation and verification screens. The result? Would-be buyers never complete the transaction, and the sale is lost. Other firms have tackled this link with more imagination. Amazong.com, for instance, created a one-click system in which repeat customers can simply press a single button on the screen and order from pre stored information with no further effort. Of course, stores in the bricks-and-mortar realm are also guilty of making purchasing difficult, as anyone who has ever waited in an endless checkout line at a major discount store can affirm. 
5. *Delivery* How does an offering get from you to the customer? Firms such as CD-Now promise to revolutionise the consumption of music from recorded media by making it possible for customers to create their own CD-Rom disks, in batches of one. Rather than having to go to a music store or purchase music from a catalog, the customer creates his or her own collection. Audible.com, a firm that provides an Internet site with downloadable content, and a special, Walkman-line device on which this can be played back. For many other kinds of firms, such as commodity shippers, construction companies, and food and newspaper companies, delivery has significant competitive implications as well. 
6. *Payment* How does the customer pay? How do you receive payment? Optimising the payment link can improve business in multiple ways. Obviously, if payment is more convenient, that helps to differentiate your product. Consider Mobil’s Speedpass. Customers enrolled in the Mobile Speedpass system use a miniature radio transmitter attached to a key chain or to their car’s rear window. The transponders transmit a special code that is recognised by a receiver in the pump. The two devices then simply charge the customers’ fuel purchase to a designated credit or checking card. This eliminates the hassle of waiting while a credit card is charged, or conversely having to handle cash. Research showed that customers who used Speedpass technology purchased gasoline at Mobil an average of one time more per month than those not using the Speedpass. *Think about the considerable advantage this is giving Mobil in terms of market share - all because the company recognized that customers wanted more speed and convenience at the pump.* (link to the existing market: faster/better products needed see market types framework)
7. *Receipt* Once customers have it, what do they do with it? Questions to consider with respect to receipt, especially with service offerings, are whether the process can be made more convenient, more efficient, or more enjoyable. One of our favourite examples is Progressive Insurance, which we mentioned in chapter 2. It’s hard to imagine a more responsive or rapid way to receive claims adjustment services than to have an adjuster in a mobile van settle the claim right at the scene of the accident. Not only that, but think of the reassurance Progressive provides by helping clients locate all the parties needed to get the car repaired, get a rental car, and tend to any insurance concerns raised by medical issues. 
8. *Installation and Assembly* How des your customer put the product to work? An example of capitalising on installation difficulties is how Otis Elevator used wireless technology to expand the market for its remote elevator-monitoring systems. Otis Elevator formed an alliance with Novatel Wireless and Bell Atlantic Mobile to tackle installation problems with Otis’s remote elevator-monitoring systems. Customers previously used land-line modems to rely information about elevator performance to OTISLINE, the company’s twenty-four-hour maintenance dispatching centre. This required the installation of phones lines in the elevator machine room. If for whatever reason it was infeasible to install phone lines, the customer could not use the service. The three companies developed a solution in which a wireless Novatel modem could be used to communicate information directly to Otis, eliminating the need for phone lines. Novatel executives estimate that this technology would allow Otis to reach a market of over 60,000 elevators that might otherwise not have been suitable for the service. 
9. *Storage and Transport* What bothers or worries the customer about storing the product? In the industrial gas business, for example, focus on storage and transportation of the product by leading producers has transformed the way business is done in the industry. 
10. *Use* What is going on while the customer is using the product. What help does the customer need in using the product? BOS Gases again provides a good example in this area. The company created significant value by assisting its customers to reduce the total systems cost of using gases int he biotechnology industry. In addition to these services designed to make their products easier or less expensive to use, BOC also offers a special technical hot line, a support service that proved customers with information and support for handling its products. 
11. *Service* What happens when the offering needs service? How is it provided? A good example of a company that differentiates on the basis of service is Otis Elevator, with its remote diagnostics systems. In high-traffic office buildings, Otis can predict possible service interruptions and send maintenance staff to carry out evening preventive maintenance before the elevator actually fails. 
12. *Repairs and Returns* What happens when the offering needs repair or is returned or canceled? Retailers are finding that differentiating on the basis of ease of repairs and returns is one way to combat the incursions of Internet-based businesses in their markets. Most online merchants require that customers wishing to return products ship them back to their warehouses. Dayton Hudson’s Target stores, however, are betting that they can differentiate their offering by allowing consumers to return items purchased on-line at any one of their 881 bricks-and-mortar stores (withdrawals at our business). Still others find the process of having to deal with a return when they expected a painless shopping experience particularly vexing. Difficulties in arranging returns and gettign service are a budding enrager in this increasingly rich market (Internet). 
13. *Final Disposal* What does the customer do with the offering once it’s no longer of any use? All good things come to an end, which raises the question of whether there is a way to differentiate by increasing the convenience of disposing of the exhausted product. Canon, for instance, has developed a system that allows customers to return used-up copier cartridges, which are, then rehabilitated. This creates a positive feeling of being environmentally responsible for the customer, while at the same time enhancing the image of Canon as environmentally friendly. The disposal link can be particularly profitable if you can structure disposal in such a way that the customer is naturally led to replace the exhausted or obsolete product with your next-generation offering. 

### Improving the Links in a Consumption Chain

The purpose of consumption chain analysis is to help you identify opportunities to differentiate-opportunities with the potential to go beyond what your firms and other are doing today. 

*Search* How do people search for a family car?
* Go to the same dealer with the purpose of buying the latest model of current auto
* Go to different dealers with the purpose of buying the latest model of current auto
* Go to different dealers to find a newer, used model of current auto
* Go to different dealers and compare new and/or used models of different autos
* Watch TV ads and go to the advertised dealers
* Read all the ads in automobile section of newspaper
* Search on-line
* Discuss the purchase in detail with friends and relatives
* Consult Consumer Reports in print
* Consult Consumer Reports on-line
* Visit several dealers to see comparable autos
* Do multiple test drives of many autos
* Read dozens of industry magazines, do detailed analysis, and then do multiple test drives

For instance, if you wanted to target people who usually buy the latest model of the car they currently own, you might target advertising to them when models change if you are the current provider,  or offer a target discount and a point-by-point comparison of why your car is superior at the time models change.

*Storage and Transport* How do people stock (and carry) headache pills? 
* Wait until the pills have run out and then buy replacement pills
* Keep single replacements available in the medicine closet at home
* Keep backup replacements in the medicine closet
* Carry the pills in a briefcase or purse
* Carry the pills in a briefcase or purse and keep a backup at home
* Carry the pills in a briefcase or purse and keep a backup at home and in the office
* Buy new pills when they have a headache and level half-empty packs laying around at home, eventually to be discarded. 

Here we could speculate that customers with different storage and transport habits might find different kinds of packaging or promotion enticing. For instance, if some customers buy pills only as needed, why would they want to buy a large box? A little box or an envelope will do. Those customers who carry pills with them routinely, however, may want a box because sturdy packaging keeps their pills from being pulverised while carried from one place to another. 

*Use* How do people handle difficulties with product use? For example, what might different customer segments do with respect to an expensive sweatshirt that has shrunk in the wash?

* Throw it out with a philosophical attribute-this is the kind of thing that just happens sometimes and there’s no need to get upset about it. 
* Throw it out and complain to family
* Throw it out and complain to family, friends, and co-workers.
* Throw it out and vow never to purchase that brand again
* Throw it out and vow never again to purchase that brand or anything from the store where it was bought
* Call the store and complain over the phone
* Visit the store an complain in person
* Visit the store in person and demand a refund

Here again, different customer segments will respond differently to the way in which your organisation handles this kind of problem. If they fall into the “throw it out and never buy that brand again,” you’ll never know how you lost them. Because these may be some of your most profitable customers, you need to find a way to encourage them to take some action when they are dissatisfied with a purchase. For instance, many firms offer *full refunds* if an unsatisfactory product is returned. This allows yo to analyse what the problem was and try to recapture that customer’s confidence. Totally different actions may be called for with the noisier segments of customers-some of whom may have a legitimate beef about the sweatshirt but who may also be unrepresentative of the kinds of customers you want.  For instance, they may chronically ignore the use and care instructions for clothing and create the problem themselves. 

*Purchase* How might quizzing be used to differentiate customer behaviour in, say the purchase of consumer gasoline? Differentiating consumer gasoline sales is tough. There are many questions you might ask: What are consumers doing when purchasing gasoline? They may be commuting to work, going on a measure trip, going on a business trip, going shopping, going on vacation etc. The next step in the quizzing process is to select one of these contexts for further inquiry. Let us select “Going on a business trip.” Who are these customers with when purchasing gasoline for the purposes of a business trip?  They could be alone, traveling with one or more business partners, traveling with a group of people, or traveling with a spouse.  Let us say that a potential customer is going on a business trip alone. The logical next question might be to consider where the customer might buy the gasoline. He or she might buy it at the local gas station the person usually uses, at convention locations between cities en route, or at gas stations that is pre-approved by the person’s company, even if it isn’t the one he or she personally uses.  Suppose we are interested in capturing customers who are buying along the route to a destination other than their home or workplace. We might then think about when they would be likely to make their purchase. They could by gasoline mainly during daylight hours, sometimes at night, mainly during the week or sometimes during the weekend.  Let#s say now that we want to focus on those who sometimes have to buy gas en route at night. What might concern these customers who are making an uncustomary purchase? They might worry about getting lost, having enough money to pay, having to stop again, or running out of gas, or their personal safety while making the purchase. Now let us further define the “who” we are dealing with by deciding to focus on women, driving alone, on long business trip that might require them to stop during odd hours during the night in unknown places for gas.  Several ideas for differentiation present themselves. One would be to reconfigure the gas station along highways that are principal driving (as opposed to flying) business routes to appeal to the concerns of this segment. 
* Well-lit stations
* Gas station attendants to pump gas
* A local travel adviser at each gas station with detailed knowledge of the area-for instance, which roads are safe, which exits should be avoided, which restaurant stops are pleasant and safe, and which hotels might be appropriate
* A loaner mobile phone that will be given to them at the first station on their trip and taken back at the last station

Going s step further, you might specially cater to this segment by setting up a travel chain that would extend from gas station to gas station. Each time your customer buys gas, the station calls ahead to the next station on the route to alert attendants there of her expected plans and destination If she doesn’t arrive within a specified time, this service might send a car out to look for her. This example raises a few points that are worth nothing. First, once your gas stations have a reputation for being safer, you can capture spillover effects:  
1. People will be inclined to stop there irrespective of whether it is night or day, whether they are alone or not. 
2. *Second, not all of these ideas will be profitable. Before making a big investment in restructuring stations or adding services, you would have to consider whether there would be enough customers in the target group and enough spillover to make your efforts worthwhile.* 
3. A third point is that there is no reason you have to provide all the material for differentiation yourself. You can ask partners to participate in the redifferentiation program. They will provide important components without any expense or investment on your part. Now that’s entrepreneurial thinking. 

## Mapping the Attributes of the Consumption Chain
Every link in the consumption chain is laden with attributes that can be mapped to further differentiate a product or service for a particular customer segment. The tools of attribute mapping and consumption chain analysis are mode more powerful when used together. 

### Case Study with Progressive Insurance
Suppose a Progressive enrollee has just had an automobile collision and her car requires moderate body. She is a very busy person who has little time to devote to such problems. The attribute map for the receipt of insurance services for such as person might look like the one in figure 4-4

Busy people will be highly gratified to receive on-the-spot claim assessments and a loaner auto to drive while repairs are being made. A smaller group of such people-will also be relatively price-insensitive. They will tolerate higher deductibles and more substantial premiums because saving time, not money, is a key driver of value for them. These might well be the most desired target segment for Progressive. Providing these customers with fast, efficient service not only is likely to increase their propensity to repurchase but is also likely to spur them to spread the word, giving Progressive positive word-of-mounts reference. On the other hand, having to set aside time to complete lengthy, cumbersome forms is likely to be a source of great dissatisfaction for these customers, and being dropped for coverage is likely to be enraging.

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-10%20at%2015.20.19.png)

Breaking the customer’s experience into the component consumption chain links makes even more detailed attribute mapping possible.  *You can start to systematically identify opportunities for differentiation by building an attribute map for each segment at each link in the consumption chain.* The goal is to make sure that you are aware of what attributes fall into which categories for key customer segments at each link in the chain. 

You can then begin to ask questions like this: 
* How can we deliver the positive attributes faster, more cheaply and otherwise better than we do now?
* How might we reduce or remove negative and neutral attributes?
* How can we meet new needs that customers may be developing?
* What might customers find useful if only we could give it to them?

The answers to each of these questions will show you the opportunities to move from the attribute maps in place today to the blockbuster offerings that can drive profitability tomorrow (use opportunity register to capture opportunities). 

### Identifying the Triggers That Precipitate Customer Action

Customers move from one link to another in the chain on the basis of trigger events. These are events that cause a new need to emerge, that change the customer’s perspective on a need, or that signal the end of a consumption event. For instance, the search for a new product is often triggered when the customer’s current product breaks down or becomes obsolete.  *Triggers will differ by customer segment.* People who like to drive late-model cars, for instance, will be triggered to look for a new car simply by the passage of time (early adopters). On the other hand, someone who likes to tinker may happily go on driving a vehicle that requires frequent attention. Consider washing machines and other household appliances. Some customers will replace their appliances whenever they move, fashions change, or new features are offered.  Others will use them util they are worn completely out. All too often, companies lump these very different segments together in a useless, generic category, like “upper-income suburban families”. *Companies often fail to check their assumptions about what triggers a move along the consumption chain for a particular segment.* /(events can be used for marketing automation for instance, someone who moves from a city to another city can be targeted via facebook)/

It’s worth spending the time to identify the key events that lead them to transition between links-awareness of need, search, selection, purchase and so on. You must then decide who within your firm is in the best position to spot these events, so that when they occur you will be informed and poised to react. For instance, your complaint line and technical support people may be the most likely to have the information before anyone else does. 

### Differentiating within Customer Segments

If you have a number of different customer segments, each will have its own consumption chain. In that case, your first task is to pin down the entire consumption chain for your product or service, segment by segment. If possible, call or personally interview, distributors, customers, and customer service. Start with 2-3 segments you think are of most interest and return to other segments later. *The one question Whirlpool (case study from the book box 4-1) should ask before going to serve my customer segment is whether the segment is big enough and price-insensitive enough to make it worth the company’s while. If not, then they shouldn’t bother.* 

### Mobilising the Organisation 
Mapping the consumption chains for your most important segments represents an area in which getting multiple people involved can rally pay off, particularly people who are directly engaged with the customers. 

CEO of American Airline led to the continuous redifferentiation of the frequent-flyer offering for business-class passengers. American began by borrowing from Scandinavian Airlines System the idea of developing a different service offering for business-class traveler than for coach-class travelers. Business class separated out the highly desirable business segment from ether first class or coach class. Breaking out the business-class segment from others was a concept that was then extended into other service offerings. Thus, frequent business travelers were offered what was essentially a special discount in the form of frequent-flyer miles, which allowed them to take personal travel inexpensively after accumulating enough corporate travel. Business customers were encouraged to stay local to American by having their mileage program linked to car rentals, and then hotel stays. No advantage lasts forever. Other airlines aggressively entered the competition for the business-class passenger. For years, however, American was considered the airline of choice for the business-class passenger, easily the most profitable segment of customers for airline services. CEO of American Airlines was relentless in his focus on finding new links in the frequent-flyer consumption chain to use for differentiation. For years he made the American Airlines frequent-fleyer program the easiest for customers to work with - from recording miles to cashing them in, making reservations, and receiving tickets. *The major benefit was his emphasis on saving time and hassle for that most important business segment.*

## Summary of Action Steps
1. For each significant customer segment (and perhaps each key distributor and key supplier), sketch out the consumption chain. Do so by interviewing-or including-as many people as possible who are in direct contact with the customer at any link. 
2. Identify the trigger events that precipitate customer movement from link to link in their chain (awareness, search, selection, etc.) Articulate how your organisation could get the information to know when a customer is moving from one link to another. 
3. Put in place procedures to alert you when the trigger is pulled, and plan your responses when it does. Get the people responsible for executing the response on board-knowing what the trigger is and what do do when it is pulled. 
4. Starting with the order/purchase and use links, start quizzing to get at needed that may not be met appropriately as products and services are currently configured. If one of the questions (what, who, when, where, or how) leads to a dead end, go on to another. 
5. Create an attribute map for each major link in the consumption chain, for each important segment that you serve or seek to serve, again beginning with ordering/purchasing and use. Later move on to other links in the chain. 
6. Use your insights into the customer’s experiential context at each link to identify opportunities to forge a blockbuster offering for each segment you intend to serve.
7. Put the ideas that you generate into your opportunity register.
8. Revisit the process above with each of the other links in your customer#s consumption chain.
9. Repeat the process for other key stakeholders (like brokers, distributors, suppliers). 


# Chapter 5 Disrupting The Rules of The Game
In this chapter, we focus on a third approach to capturing opportunities by developing new business models: reshaping your competitive markets. We begin with methods that can be used to *resegment existing markets.* By resegmenting, we mean honing in on, or better serving, subsegments of existing markets. We move on to explore how you can initiate increasingly challenging moves that actually reconfigure the competitive arena.  *Reconfiguring an arena means completely changing the existing basis for segmentation by altering existing value chains or introducing entirely new types of solutions.* 

## Scoping out new market segments
The idea that clusters of customers can be targeted based on certain similarities is nothing new. Typically, firms segment customers on the basis of demographics: age, gender, geo etc. The problem with this is that demographic profile often don#t behave in the same way, don’t have the same needs, and won’t share the same perception of value. 

### Observe Behaviour to Uncover Need, Uncover Need to Discover New Markets (Resegmentation)

The upshot is that an entrepreneurial mindset calls for insights into the people in the target segment’s behaviour rather than settling for the same old segments everyone else uses. Ideally, you not only discover a new segment, but can actually carve this segment out of conventional ones by resegmenting. 

So, here’s the challenge. Can you identify a significant subset of customers whose behaviour and motivation are not well served by companies using conventional segmentation approaches? Finding them involves discovering two things: 
1. First, what is different about the needs of this subsegment that is reflected in behavioural differences, 
2. and second, how can you respond in such a ways that your offering is more compelling than those of competitors?  

## Resegmentation Model
Traditionally, business-to-business customers for telecommunications equipment have been *segmented by size, geographic reach and industry.* We started quizzing, as usual, this time focusing on the use link in the consumption chain. When we started to ask the “what” questions (what was the customer doing when using telecommunications, what else was going on at the time and so forth), we identified and zeroed in one the occasions when our client’s customers were using telecommunications to sell (as opposed to order, schedule, coordinate, etc.) We noticed an intriguing set of sub patterns. While nearly all the companies used telecommunications to support their sales efforts, the way in which they employed telecommunications for selling cut across the way the industry was segmented at the time-*by industry, sector, and geography*. We began to look at whether these different selling behaviours might provide a meaningful basis for resegmentation. We named the *first potential new segment* /order capturers/. These firms marketed heavily in the media to attract interest in their offerings, then used incoming telecommunications to take orders. Their key needs involved capturing and processing incoming orders as fast as possible. This was doubly important in the consumer-oriented business within this segment, in which many customers make calls on impulse.

*The second category,* which we called /customer seekers/ (to be polite), consisted of a group of companies that make telemarketing calls en masse.  Their key needs were for extremely efficient dealing and redialing, for extensive linkages to databases of information on target customers, and for ease of use-since much of their workspace is high-turnover and transitory, these companies don’t have time to train their telemarketers. 

*The third segment*, /sales force leveragers/, were companies that use the phone to coordinate the activities of their sales force across many points of sale.  PepsiCo was a pioneer in this approach, aggressively using communications between a large, mobile sales force and the firm#s distribution warehouses to offer high-speed, high-quality service to its retailers customers. Companies like PepsiCo needed integrated sales communications with other operational systems and highly efficient two-way communication. 

Interestingly, even when they were of similar size, geographic reach, or target industry, the firms in different behavioural segments had different priorities. The result was that each segment needed a different kind of sales telecommunication configuration, as shown in figure 5-1.

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%2010.49.44.png)

## Design a Blockbuster Attribute Map for Each Segment
*After we used quizzing to resegment the telecommunications customer groups, we then started thinking about ideal attribute maps for each of these key segments.*

*A telecommunications package designed to service one segment would not meet the requirements of the other two.* At the same time, a package designed to meet the essential needs of all three segments would have to incorporate many potentially expensive, neutral attributes (from the point of view of the segments that don’t care about them). The remote connectivity prized by sales force leverages is a matter of indifference to order capturers and customer seekers.  They certainly aren’t going to pay premium prices for services they don’t care about. The goal was to envision what characteristics in an attribute map might make it a blockbuster success for a given target segment. *Remember, the blockbuster concept means creating a bundle of attributes that are so perfectly aligned with the needs of a target segment that the customer is almost compelled to buy from you.* 

Let’s first take the order capturer segment and determine what its blockbuster attribute map might look like. A simplified version is shown in figure 5-2

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%2010.57.21.png)
![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%2010.57.08.png)

The nonnegotiable attribute, caller self-routing, allows a caller to enter Touch-Tone numbers to quickly work his or her way down a decision tree to the correct telephone operator. Programmed call prioritises might be differentiators. These allow the firm to program the system to categorise and then prioritise incoming calls. When there are inevitable periods of system overload. priority is given to calls with area codes that represent the location of customers most likely to purchase. In a more sophisticated system, certain key customers numbers with solid records of purchase histories could be given priority. 

On the other side, limited line capabilities would be tolerable, provided that competitors were not able to offer more lines for the same price. If competitors should develop hardware that proved greater line capacity per unit price, then the tolerable will become a dissatisfier. Finally if the order capturer’s system fails, it loses business for every second the system is down, which qualifies this attribute as an enrager. 

This segment would be totally indifferent to all the remote connectivity features one might ofer a sales force leverager, so these attributes would be “so whats?” Likewise, the speed-dealing features that one might offer an order seeker could be considered “parallel” since the order capturer is hardly going to base its purchase decision on this attribute. 

Our client went back to representative companies from the target segments with revised attribute maps (for selling and for other telecommunications activities). The reaction was favorable-so much so that our client was able to ask for more aggressive pricing than it had previously dared to try, leveraging the claim that it was designing systems tailored to the way their clients did business. *What’s more, because this way of segmenting on the basis of behaviour was not initially obvious, our client gained a significant edge on the competition by developing software packages custom-designed for each segment.*

### Seek Resegmentation Opportunities Systematically

One sign that you may have an opportunity for resegmentation is when a significant subset of customers undergoes a similar experience at a link in the consumption chain that is quite different from other subsets of customers.  For instance, if all firms that seek customers have the same needs at the usage link, even through they operate in different industries, are of different sizes, and service different customer sets, they may represent a viable new segment even if they would not be picked by conventional methods. Again, you can apply this approach at nay link in the consumption chain-you can segment on the basis of how the people behave when they search, when they order, when they purchase, when they use the offering and so on. 

## Case Study
Sometimes resegmentation can be created on the basis of the most mundane of activities. Take payment for instance. Our client was a distributor of electrical supplies that was experiencing problems with many late payments. On investigation, we found that a number of delinquents were paying late because they were contractors who were only paid after their contracting job was finished. They had to wait until their client paid them before they in turn could pay our client. The resegmetnation opportunity this represented was adding features to allow the contractors to better manage their own cash flow in exchange for more aggressive payment terms, thus carving this segment out of the mainstream customers base for electric supplies. 

*Any time you spot a difference in behaviour, you may be looking at an opportunity to resegment, just as in the telecommunications and electrical distribution cases. We don’t mean to imply that you have to throw out all your existing segmentation work, by the way. The idea is to make sure that you segment on the basis of insights with respect to customers’ behaviour throughout their consumption chain.*

When we can, we like to be systematic about discovering segmentation opportunities by using a grid similar to that in figure 5-3. _After applying consumption chain analysis and quizzing at a particular link, list your potential behavioural segments_ across the top of the chart and the major attributes you believe to be important for the segments down the side. 
Feel free to include the current industry segments in the analysis, since this may highlight places where adding or removing attributes will create major opportunities to disrupt the current segment. Then, in the cells, enter your best judgment as to how each potential segment would categorise the attribute (non-negotiable, tolerable, etc.). *If you have done a good job of segmenting, attributes will be regarded differently by each segment.*  In particular, there should be several attributes that separate the segments in terms of their reactions, evoking different negative, positive, or neutral reactions in the different segments.  Using a grid like that in figure 5-3 helps to simplify the question of which customer segments can be created or reshaped or collapsed by changing the attributes of your offering. 
*It can highlight four kinds of opportunities:*
1. Opportunities to resegment by adding attributes that competitors don’t offer
2. Opportunities to get rid of attributes that some segments find dissatisfying, tolerable, or neutral
3. Opportunities to change the way positive attributes are offered or to reduce the hassle or undesirability of negative attributes
4. Opportunities to collapse segments together by adding or removing attributes

For instance, if attribute 5 in Figure 5-3 is not currently being offered by competitors, segment 4 in the grid represents an opportunity for resegmentation. The segment differs from all other in that it insists on attribute 1 (which is a nonnegotiable for this segment) and is the only segment that finds attribute 5 to be differentiating. If competitors are not currently offering attribute 5, you may be able to create and dominate a niche in segment 4 by coming up with a design that incorporates attributes 1 and 5 and downplays (or even removes) the other attributes, thereby reducing costs. 

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-11%20at%2011.57.09.png)

Many software packages (such as the statistical analysis package SAS and SPSS) have this quality-they provide software that delivers solutions to specialised problems that may not be particularly appealing to may users but are essential to some-and they often require time-consuming programming, a tolerable which requires training of users. By being the first to offer a graphic interface that eliminated the need for programming, SPSS captured many customers that had been loyal to SAS. 

You can also begin to consider what attributes you might want to modify in your current offerings, perhaps to the point of removing some.  Consider segments 2 and 5, both of which find attribute 1 tolerable. If you could remove attribute 1, you might collapse and capture both segments by pushing competitors into a situation where their product is now dissatisfying and yours isn’t 

Another kind of opportunity is opened up by more or less universal negative attributes. For instance, look at attribute 2. For every segment, this attribute is either a “so what?” a tolerable, or dissatisfying. In eliminating this attribute, you would improve your attribute map relative to others and perhaps even reduce your costs. If you get there first, this could become a differentiating selling point. 

You can also use this map to see whether there are opportunities to collapse one or more segments together, which should gain the potential scale advantages of a larger market. *If you could remove or reduce the impact of attributes 1 and 2, you could reconfigure the entire market into three segments, that largest of which you could dominate.* Three segments would consists of the old segment 4 that wants attribute 1 (you would lose this customer segment), the old segment 1 that remains indifferent to attributes 1 and 2 (and where you would still have competition), and a large new segment comprising old segments 2,3, and 5 (where your new offering has removed a dissatisfier or tolerable for each of these old segments). 

### Case Study
Amazon.com’s  book sales is an example. For one segment, the behavioural segment of people who are fond of browsing books, the ability to visit the store is a nonnegotiable. For many other segments, however, having to physically visit a store to make a purchase is a tolerable that become a dissatisfier when Amazon.com made online ordering easy and secure. For instance, anyone who needs a book but is pressed for time would enjoy the convenience. People who need to access more material than what a conventional bookstore would regularly stock would also be drawn to Amazon’s offerings. But, of course, anyone who needs the book immediately and doesn’t want to wait for delivery would not be satisfied with the Amazon.com offering. 

A caveat is in order at this point: you cannot rest on your laurels. in the telecommunications case, and for the illustration we have discussed in relation to figure 5-3,  your success will oblige your competition to follow sooner or later (with luck, later), as happened to Amazon.com. Enter all the resegmentation ideas in your register. Once you have entered all the opportunities to resegment in the your register, you can begin to look at opportunities to reconfigure your markets.

### Uncovering Opportunities for Reconfiguration 

What often prevents theoretically great business ideas from getting off the ground is a technological, regulatory, or organisational *barrier* that gets in the way of implementation.  We define barriers as the forces that set limits on the attributes you can offer or on the way in which consumption chains can be configures. This brings us to our second recommended approach to transforming your competitive arena: *breaking down the barriers that cause the current market to be structured as it is-we call this market reconfiguration.*

## Market Reconfiguration
To develop an understanding of what barriers you most need to eliminate, you first need to go back to the major attribute maps that you developed for the use and purchase links in your consumption chain analyses. Your reconfiguration challenge will be different, depending on the nature of the barriers: how much impact their removal will have on the market and how much of a challenge their removal will present. There are three types of reconfiguration.
1. Evolutionary reconfiguration: break through current barriers to create an enhancement of your current offering.
2. Radical reconfigurations: break through barriers in a way that allows you to significantly change the structure of your current markets.
3. Revolutionary reconfigurations bring new products to markets that do not currently buy your products. 

## Evolutionary Reconfigurations
To consider whether you have the chance to spark an evolutionary reconfiguration, go back to the attribute maps you developed for the major links in the consumption chain of your current business. Then start asking yourself these questions:
* What is stopping us from delivering positive attributes faster, better, and more cheaply than we do now?
* What is stopping us from reducing or removing negative and neutral attributes?
* What is stopping us from adding attributes fro which customers have expressed a desire?
* Why can’t we do something that would make a positive attribute more universally appealing?

Having identified an initial list of barriers, you now dig deeper by working the powerful so-called five whys! This requires you to ask at least five levels of why questions for each barrier. 

Consider Citibank’s unenviable situation with its credit cards in inflationary 1970s. New York State’s usury laws capped interest rates, and Citibank was thereby forces to charge consumers less than its costs for capital for credit card debt. The New York State Legislature, despite numerous appeals, failed to act to raise the limits. Had Citibank carried out a five-whys exercise, the questions might looked like this:
1. Why can’t we charge higher interest rates? Because New York state law (where the credit card operation was located) caps interest rates at 14 percent.
2. Why can’t we get the law changed? We have been lobbying and care in negotiations with the legislature, but they are currently unwilling to act.
3. Why are they unwilling to act? Because the cardholders in New York will blame the legislators for high interest charges; it is seen as politically unpopular.
4. Why do we have to stay in New York and be subject to New York state law? We’ve traditionally been located in New York.
5. Why couldn’t we move the credit card operation to a location where the unpopularity of interest rate ceilings would be of less concern to regulators? This would be a big adjustment for our company and people.
6. But is there any substantive reason why we couldn’t move somewhere else? Not really.

This line of reasoning ultimately led Citibank to move its credit card operation to South Dakota. As you consider specific barriers, think about whether removing them might reconfigure the market or create new market spaces, or whether shifting their configuration could help you carve out a new and desirable segment or, conversely, collapse several subsegments into a larger group.  You may see that certain barriers recur across several opportunities for reconfiguration. The removal of such barriers is an opportunity in and of itself, so add them to the opportunity register. In this situation, the opportunity that you list simply becomes the removal or reduction of the barrier. 

When you find a barrier that is the result of your company’s policies, you may have come across a great opportunity to change the way your company competes. 

### Case Study

Citibank, for instance turned the credit card business on its head and created a multibillion-dollar opportunity by changing an internal barrier related to the definition of a creditworthy customer. In traditional banking, a creditworthy customer is a person with lots of assets, stable employment, and a good credit repayment record, until one of our interviewees at Citibank had the imagination to ask themselves why this mattered. “After all,” said the senior executives, “as long as the bill gets paid, why do we care what the customer’s credit record is? Instead of viewing any bad debt loss as something to be avoided in traditional banking’s risk-averse culture, the team at Citibank began to refer to such losses as the financial services equivalent of “cost of goods sold.” This breakthrough transformed the credit card business as it is today. Literally millions of people who would have a difficult time obtaining a conventional bank loan can borrow thousands on their cards (at premium interest rates, too). 
For instance, this created a major advantage for Citibank in the college student market. Under traditional criteria, college students are a terrible credit risk they have no job own no home or other major asset than can be repossessed, are transient, and have no history of reliable repayment.  But once you focus on whether the bill will be paid, it turns out that most students are a pretty good risk for a credit card, because Mom or Dad will usually come through in the event that the student overspends. Citibank gained a hugely profitable, dominant franchise with the college student segment by removing this internal barrier years before the competition caught up. 

## Radical Reconfigurations 
Entrepreneurially minded entrants to existing markets often take advantage of incumbents by creating a compelling new business model. Incumbent players then find themselves locked behind barriers stemming from their long-established ways of doing things or their investments in sunk assets. When the need for change finally becomes undeniable, incumbents may find that they have few or no customers left-the attributes they offer have been rendered inadequate by firms that created a new minimum level of acceptable performance with breakthrough business model. 

Of particular interest are two types of reconfiguration that radically change currently successful attribute sets. These are the radical reconfiguration of functionality, and the radical reconfiguration of consumption and value chains. 

### Radical Reconfiguration of Functionality

Functionality is radically reconfigures when a new entrant allows customers to meet need, in a revolutionary way, that could never be met before.  The rapid replacement of impact-based printing by laser-driven printing is a case in point. The rapid invasion of digital cameras into markets formerly dominated by 35-millimeter point-and-shoot cameras is a current example. With advent of high-quality, low-priced colour printers, capturing simple images is now possible at relatively low cost. Meanwhile, digital cameras allow people to do things such as upload images to the Internet, send them by e-mail, and capture them in overheads and written materials, which can’t be done using a conventional camera. 

### Radical Reconfiguration of Consumption and Value Chains

Michael Porter, in his 1985 book Competitive Advantage, laid out the idea of the value chain as the set of linked activities that occur to create a product or service, beginning with the acquisition of raw materials through delivery of final service after sale. Typically, each consumption chain link has its own associated value chains. For instance, in doing the wash, a consumer’s “usage” link might involve the value chains of the washing machine manufacturer, the detergent provider the designer and manufacturer of the clothing being washed, and the electricity and water utility providers. This intersection of value chains and consumption chains opens the opportunity for a second type of disruption. This happens when you reconfigure the value chain so as to become better, faster, or less costly, while still delivering the same basic need at the given link in the consumption chain. Shifts that thereby dismember existing value chains are often difficult to comprehend at first because the differences from the previous way of doing business may not obvious. 

A recent example of a firm that has radically reconfigured the value chain for sales of electronic equipment is PC/Mac Connection, which allows customers to search for, select, order, pay for, and assemble their home or office computer system, including all software and peripherals, in a single phone call. An experienced representative works through the customer’s needs on the phone and then recommends the most appropriate configuration. If the customer then provides a credit card number, the entire system - with software loaded and upgrades installed is delivered the next day. As of this writing, the Internet has already demonstrated its potential to revolutionise value chains. An example is e-Steel, a site developed specifically for the $700 billion global steel industry. The site allows buyers and sellers to connect; professional buyers and sellers to exchange information; purchasers to put up order for bid; and suppliers to post information such as production availability or inventory levels in stock. The gains in efficiency such sites make possible completely transform the way procurement and purchasing are handled. This changes the economics of the business rapidly, making obsolete any incumbents that rely on “business as usual”. 

When the logic that previously held together value chains (often based on the business’s constraints of time, location, or information flow) evaporates, the business model associated with them does as well. Countering such shifts can be almost impossible to do within the framework of the existing business. For instance, when the brokerage firm Merrill Lynch announced that it would offer on-line stock trading to compete with new Internet-based entrants, its stock dropped by 10 percent, as analysts judged that the new business would cannibalise the firm’s highly profitable broker-based business. It takes real entrepreneurial leadership to resist the pressures to cling desperately to the old model. A radical reconfiguration of either type can pose either a significant threat or an opportunity. It can yield a phenomenal new basis for competing, or it can effectively make obsolete and replace your current business model. In either case, your task is to try to anticipate such potential disruptions. 

## Is there Potential for Radical Reconfiguration of the Current Business Model?
To what extent do you see the following patterns emerging in your markets? Enter next to each item below the number that corresponds with your conclusion: 1 = not at all, 2 = to some extent, 3 = a great deal.

_ One or more steps in our value chain could be completely eliminated by new developments in the near future.
_ We are facing enormous pressure to reduce prices or to offer more value for the same prices.
_ For one or more links in the consumption chains for our most important segments, the customers’ needs could be met in completely new ways.
_ For one or more links in the consumptions chains for our most important segments, the customers’ needs are being met by competitors from an industry other than the one we primarily associate ourselves with.
_ Many new entrants have come into our markets, but are serving customers segments that we don’t care about.
_ Solutions developed for market segments that we currently find unattractive are improving rapidly in terms of price, functionality, or other attributes.
_ The factors that kept our customers loyal seem to be losing their potency. 
_ We need to be facing a wave of consolidations and acquisitions in our industry.
_ We are experiencing completely new sources of competition compared with those we have historically faced.
_ Customers increasingly view our offerings as commodities. 

_Scoring: add the numbers. If you score less than 12, the current potential for disruption is low. If you score between 12 and 20, you have a moderate potential for disruption. Scores higher than 20 suggest that you should actively be considering your actions in anticipation of disruptive change._

Also try to identify opportunities to proactively reconfigure the game yourself, by identifying projects that you could use to radically disrupt the current industry. *Enter your ideas for configuring your business into your opportunity register.*

## Revolutionary Reconfiguration
This last type of reconfiguration completely reshapes current business models and delivers an offering with completely new and different attributes. 

We  suggest your approach revolutionary reconfigurations with a focus completely different from any you have considered so far - a focus on which customers or markets are not being attracted to your offering. Start by working through the series of questions we list below. As you explore these questions, you can garner ideas for revolutionary new offerings that are out of the box as far as thinking about the current markets is concerned. 

*Who are not our customers?* Take the example of laptop computers, which was the focus of a team we recently worked with. There are millions of people who own laptop computers, but there are tens of millions who do not. The issue is, which groups of people who could afford a laptop do not own one, and why? It is useful to begin by focusing on negative attributes. For instance, the machines are heavy, the batteries are limited, connecting one to a network is a hassle. 

*What are some major behavioural segments of nonusers?* The next challenge is to identify several (perhaps three, for starters) different segments of nonusers that behave differently at different steps in the consumption chain. Again, we start with the usage and purchasing links. For laptop example: /The first consists/ of senior executives. Most use a cell phone, some use a personal digital assistant (PDA) but not laptop. When asked why they don’t use a laptop, their responses reflected many negatives, such as weight, complexity, and lack of need. /A second segment/ was professional laptop novices, people who use a desktop computer but have not yet felt the need to invest in a laptop. They have experimented with or own such devices as mobile phones and personal digital assistant. Complexity, cost, and keyboard-only access are huge negatives for this group. /A third segment/ was named cybervisuals. These are people whose formerly paper-based work environment either has gone or is likely to go completely digital. This group includes architects, engineers, graphic designers, system integrators, system technicians, and the like. Simultaneously, their communication patterns are moving from being predominantly local to an Internet- or intranet-based shared environment. At the moment, laptops are highly dissatisfying because image resolution is inadequate, the processing power for manipulating the images they must work with is inadequate, and sharing cumbersome. 

*What attributes of a new offering might attract the nonusers?*  As you look at the problems that these major groups of nonusers have with the existing offering you can begin to brainstorm about offerings with attributes that would solve these problems. For the time being, you should set aside the technical feasibility issue. Simply list the attributes for the solution of each and how each major segment might react. As before, we suggest that you keep it simple and try to focus on the most important attributes. Figure 5-5 shows a possible early attribute map for each of the three segments of laptop nonusers. 

As the laptop team worked on the disparate problems of these three groups of nonusers, they came up with a potentially revolutionary idea. Their concept was to do away with many of the downsides of using a laptop and creating something very different - a “super-product” that would appeal to customers who don’t use laptop’s functionality in a less expensive and friendly and more portable package. They called the innovation a mobile intelligence device.

*What would a super-product that solves all problems look like?* We have found that the most exciting place to start is to see what it would take to develop a perfect product. In the laptop example, you want to develop a description of a super-product that meets the requirements of all three segments. Aim high - you can always lower your aim later. The output of this process is a brief description, or image, of what the ultimate end product might look like as described in box 5-1. Such a device doesn’t exist and may never be feasible, but it suggests what a never-before-conceived offering might look like.

*What barriers have prevented such an offering?* Figure 5-6 illustrates the case for the ultimate MID product. This analysis makes the nature of the technical and marketing challenges crystal clear. An MID would require several simultaneous breakthroughs to become a reality for any new segment. 

![](The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/The%20entrepreneurial%20mindset,%20Rita%20Mcgrath,%20%202000/Screen%20Shot%202017-07-14%20at%2012.40.28.png)

*What barriers should we look to remove first?* Another way to state the question is, which breakthroughs have the most potential to capture brand new segments while we work on the others? *Start pragmatically by figuring out what breakthroughs are needed to satisfy the nonnegotiable for each segment.*  Figure 5-5 clearly shows that the team has the opportunity to go after the market for senior executives if it can delver a highly portable, long-life-battery laptop novices if the team can develop a light, long-life battery MID with seamless interaction. Simultaneously, look at what would be needed to create exciters. Recall that exciter features are so powerful that they can fundamentally shape the purchasing process and thereby overcome nonnegotiables. In this case of the MID, the opportunity to deliver exciter features to the senior executives involves breakthrough in remote access and bandwidth and voice or handwriting recognition. The opportunity to develop exciter features for the professional laptop novices requires breakthrough in remote access and bandwidth. For the cybervisuals, exciter features require breakthroughs in image resolution. _Should these features genuinely prove exciting to these segments, the potential super-product could allow you to access all the segments with a single design-creating significant opportunities to capture scale and scope advantages._ These opportunities should also be entered into the opportunity register.  

Finally, revisit the attribute maps for your existing business and assess the extent to which the new attributes you have identified will enhance your offering(s) for existing market segments. The more such new attributes have the potential to excite or differentiate the existing segments, the more revolutionary potential the breakthrough project has. *The above process should help you to identify opportunities to generate next-generation offerings and markets that are simply not on your current radar screen.*

## Summary of action steps

1. Analyse the current market for significant subgroups of customers who behave in ways that distinguish them from the rest of the market. Use quizzing to tease out the differences, starting with the purchase link and the usage link in the consumption chain. List all the current and potential new segments that you have identified. 
2. Develop attribute maps for all the segments, new and existing, that you consider to be target segments.
3. Complete a segment comparison grid similar to that in figure 5-3.
4. Work through the grid to find opportunities to resegment by developing alternative blockbuster designs. Enter the opportunities in your opportunity register. 
5. Revisit your major attribute maps. use the five-whys process to determine why you can’t improve on the attribute maps that you have identified, and uncover the key barriers to making improvements that will enhance positive attributes or remove key negative attributes (or make them less objectionable)
6. For each barrier, assess whether its removal could lead to significant gains. If the answer is yes, add these projects to the opportunity register aimed at reconfiguring by removing these barriers. 
7. Use the questions provided in the chapter to identify potential alternative solutions that could radically reconfigure the functionality, the value chain, or the consumption chain for your industry. If such alternative solutions pose a threat to you, identify defensive opportunities and enter them in your opportunity register. If you can identify opportunities to introduce radial reconfigurations yourself, enter them into your register as well. 
8. Identify three to five behavioural segments of nonusers of a current offering. 
9. Develop a segmentation map for these nonuser, segments, identifying attributes that you think will excite, differentiate, or be nonnegotiable for each segment. 
10. Develop a super-product concept-a description of the product that will capture all the nonuser segments. 
11. Identify all the major barriers-technological market, regulatory, and so on-that prevent you from delivering the attributes of the super-product.
12. Identify the barriers that, if removed, would allow you to deliver nonnegotiables for each segment and for the aggregation of these segments using, if necessary, the capabilities of other firms. Enter these opportunities into your register. Reperat the process for exciter features. 
13. Identify which opportunities to push back exciter and non-negotiable barriers will also have a positive impact on the attribute maps of your existing major segments. Flag these as particularly attractive opportunities. 


# Chapter 6 Building Breakthrough Competences
It takes to beat the competition in one simple way: creating superior ability to deliver on one or more key rations that drive profitability in your business. Key ratios are measurable components of your business model that allow your business to be compared to others and that give you an early indication of where your opportunities are taking your profit growth. 

*The key ratio concept invokes a core discipline you’ll need to develop an entrepreneurial mindset. This is to make things as simple as possible, and to stay focused.*

## Delivering on Key Ratios
Let’s begin with a conclusion supported by considerable research. For the vast majority of businesses, _profitability and profit growth can be anticipated on the basis of the organisation’s performance on no more than seven to ten critical numbers._ 

* *Key ratios for airline industry:* profitability has to do with the operation’s overall efficiency or how good the airline is at filling its planes.
* *Key ratios for the insurance industry:* revenues come in long before the bulk of claim expenses go out the door. The fewer the losses claimed relative to the revenue received, the greater the company’s profit. Interestingly, many companies in the insurance industry today earn the bulk of their profits not on their underwriting, but on the investment yield that they earn after premiums are received and before losses are claimed. 
* *Key rations for retailers:* The space limitation has for years led analysts of retail stores to use ratios such as same-store sales (in which sales for one period at one store are compared with a similar previous period) and sales per square foot (either compared to the store’s previous record, or compared to the performance of different stores.). Another key ratio in traditional retail businesses is thus inventory turns. 

The reason key ratios are such a powerful device for directing entrepreneurial thinking is that they help align the efforts of everyone in the company around a common set of measures.  Describing and consistently using these ratios makes abstract statements about strategy more concrete for people and helps focus their energies. Kept simple and meaningful, key ratios can be crucial. 

### One habitual entrepreneur we study uses the key ratio idea aggressively. He starts businesses and hires managers to run them, in effect operating at the centre of web of somewhat related, but independent businesses. Before handing over a business, he’ll ask a new manager to create a simple numerical model of the particular operation and to present these models to other managers.

His guiding principle is that the model should be used to help the manager achieve a ten-x target, meaning, a contribution of 10 percent growth in profits and 10 percent better profitability for the manager’s business compared with last year (if an ongoing business). If it is a new business, the ten-x target would be a 10 percent performance improvement over the manager’s average business. Asking managers to boil down the business challenge to a few key rations makes their challenges in achieving the ten-x goal more realistic. Setting key ratios in this concrete, realistic way allows our entrepreneur to operate may businesses (at last count, he had more than thirty in his portfolio) with a high level of assurance that the critical issues will be addressed without his having to micromanage people. 

After you have articulated some potentially attractive opportunities by using the techniques presented in chapter 3 through 5, your challenge now is identifying the new ratios that will drive your competitiveness. The new ratios are not accomplished without creating new competences to build their competitiveness. 

## Applying Key Ratio Analysis to Remodel a Business
First determine what the most important key ratios were, then creating the organisational competences to do better on these ratios than the competition did. 
1. We began by trying to get a sense of where the company stood. Distribution businesses in general have a well-known set of key ratios (analysts reports on your company or industry and look at the numbers they use to evaluate and project future performance). 
2. They added two metrics the percentage of customers who made the firm their first choice and the employee satisfaction index, which we though would reflect how well employees were being managed and which would in turn influence customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
3. Next, using the firm’s records and publicly available information (annual reports, public bid documents, trade records etc.), we collected data on how the business was doing relatively to the two competitors we believed to represent the most significant opposition. The result of this analysis are presented in table 6-1.

Competitive weaknesses can lead you to discover new opportunities, which emerge as you learn to overcome weaknesses through the creation of new combinations of skills, assets, and systems-or competences. New competences can generate profit in two ways. *First, if you can deliver what customers already want and expect (basic attributes) but do so at a lower cost than your competitors do, you can generate better margins than the competition’s, even without price premiums. Second, if you deliver more positive and/or fewer negative attributes than your competitors do, you can get premium prices or better payment terms.*

For instance from table 6-1 we can see the firm’s relatively higher error rates were enraging, so much so that customers in this segment bought from the firm only when they had exhausted all other options. For this segment, packing errors created enormous problems at the receipt link in their consumption chain. For them, the process of identifying errors, correcting the paperwork, and returning incorrect items was enormously costly-to the point that some would keep the incorrect items rather than go through the hassle of returning them.  But, having been through this deeply dissatisfying experience, they tended to use our client only as a last resort.  See table 6-1 Percent “preferred choice” customers.

Similar performance gaps existed int the ratios that tapped operating effectiveness. We found that the top competitors were turning inventory faster, getting paid more quickly, using less debt to finance operations, and capturing slightly higher margins than our clients were. _These gaps suggested a need to think through what new competences might be needed (1) to bring our client’s competitive profile up to industry standard and (2) to create new areas of distinctiveness._

Based on the insights from table 6-1, company has created different task force groups, first to understand the problems, second to create an strategy to close the gaps. At first, the task force groups recommended tackling the problems piecemeal, by adding staff in quality control and inspection. This didn’t satisfy our client, who didn’t believe that treating only a part of the problem would deliver the kinds of financial returns he was looking for. He elected instead to begin a process of reconfiguring the competences of the firm. As we will show, this can generate opportunities every bit as attractive as those emerging from the reconfiguration of markets and segments (discussed in chapter 4 and 5). 

Using the two new key ratios, the customer first-choice percentage and the employee satisfaction index, to explain his reasoning to his people, he showed how the numbers. were interrelated. If operations could be improved to lower error rates, return should drop. This in turn would reduce receivables and allow better control-and therefore, faster turnover-of inventories, which would in turn improve asset utilisation. Better performance on packing should help the repeat purchasing process, which in turn should allow greater volumes and better margins on the same asset base. 

In order to become better than the competition (to reconfigure the business) the company has started to build a new internet-driven system and IT competences.  To clarify the desired performance targets for the new system, the groups began to develop the performance profile depicted in table 6-2. As you can see, they planned to do much better than the competition in some areas but were realistic about the investment required to do so.

## Assessing and Developing Competences
The work done at the industrial distribution firm just discussed illustrates wha a disciplined approach to managing competences can do for a company. If a company’s competences don’t clearly influence performance on one or more key ratios, we ask why the company is spending money to sustain them.  In addressing this question, a firm can sharply curtail the number of activities people may claim to be core competences and focus their attention on the competences that really count. To determine the relative value of various competences to the firm, it is useful to divide them into three categories: mandatory, distinctive and latent.
* /Mandatory competences/ give competitive parity. Creating or acquiring the competences that allow your company to meet industry (or major competitor) performance on key ratios is not optional if you are to sustain your competitive position. 
* /Distinctive competences/ give you comparative advantage. These are the activities that lead to differentiating attributes. They allow a firm to deliver performance that positively differentiates it from competitors on a key ratio. 
* /Latent competences/ are possible activities through which your company could offer future differentiating or nonnegotiable attributes. Major sources of future competitive advantage typically emerge from the mobilisation of latent competences. 

If you cannot at least match competitive benchmarks, you will not be able to match competitors’ prices or other positive attributes for very long and success int he marketplace will not be attainable, or at least sustainable.  Furthermore, if you can’t outperform on at least one industry benchmark, you probably cannot deliver the kind of profits needed to attract prime investors in your competition for capital (see for further details 10 days delinquent accounts at GE).

## The Insights behind the Competence
The reason is that in order to capture above-average returns, the company needs to create a competitive position that competitors will find difficult to attack.

A dilemma, however, is that to capture a legitimate position in the capital markets, you must explain your strategy to analysts and investors in a way that is compelling and believable. This forces you to share critical elements of how you plan to compete. Understanding the key ratio idea can help you to tell o convincing story without necessarily giving up critical insight.

Take GEFS as an example. It would be easy for GEFS to show potential investors how superior performance in handling delinquent accounts can generate better returns without also showing them exactly how GEFS does this. Indeed, what would competitors have seen if they had spied on GEFS? They would certainly have seen things that different from industry practice - selection and training programs, use of automatic and preprogrammed telephone systems, extensive automation, and the like. What they would not have seen is the entrepreneurial insights into how emotions affect the customer’s propensity to pay. Even if they put the same training program and computer systems in place, these competitors would not be privy to one crucial element the insight that makes it all meaningful. 

## Setting the sate for Competence Creation
With the preceding examples as references, you can now think about applying the concepts of key rations analysis and competence creation to your business. The first task is to identify the seven to then benchmark ratios that you believe to be behind profit growth in a business like your. 

While you are gathering information on your industry (or your segment of it), you will start to learn about your standing in relation to competitors on each of the benchmark measures. The next step is putting these numbers together in a comparison table similar to table 6-1. Comparisons can often be found with a little persistence. Data has often been collected by commercial bankers and investment analysts to assess the relative performance of competitors. 

*Once your benchmarks are in hand, your next step is to understand how each group within your company influences performance on key ratios, which in turn affects the profitability of your business model. People can compete much more effectively if they see enough of the big picture to understand their role in profit growth. Linking functional activities to competitive benchmarks is crucial. Unless all the members of the firm know what connects their day-today actions with the firm’s performance factors, how can they possibly know how best to contribute to profitability.*

Consider telling inside salespeople that you want to increase market share. They may agree, even enthusiastically, but if they don’t know how what they do influences market share, they cannot help improve it. On the other hand, if they know that when a customer calls, they can increase market share by getting the customer to add to lines of items to the original order, they will now know what to do to increase share. This is why the server at McDonald’s asks, “Would you also like fries? A soda? and why the telephone salesperson at Lands’ End might suggest that the belt on page 23 of the catalog would look great with the shorts you just ordered. 

You are now ready to begin addressing the gaps (whether positive or negative) between your performance and that of your competitors. Adverse gaps represent opportunities from competence development. The critical questions becomes one of generating some kind of insight around which you could build a distinctive competitive position. 

## Summary of Steps
*Step 1:* Create a short list of the seven to ten key rations associated with growth and profitability for your business model. If you have multiple businesses with different business models, you will need a different set of ratios for each of them. 

*Step 2:* Collect data on your performance on each of these key ratios as well as on competitors’ performance and put together a table similar to table 6-1. Identify gaps, both positive and negative. 

*Step 3:* Whenever you are below competitive parity on one or more key ratios, repeat the five-whys exercise in chapter 5 to begin to understand why. Involve people with exposure to the diverse functions of your firm, so that they can help you make the necessary linkages among different operations. Document your findings. 

*Step 4:* if none of your key ratios shows that you have a distinctive competence, you at least have an opportunity to build new competences. Scan the opportunity register, repeat the consumption chain and attribute mapping activities described in chapter 2 and 3, or do both, with the objective of uncovering insights that might from the basis of a new, distinctive competence. 

*Step 5:* Building on these insights, start first to consider what you can do to attain competitive parity on most of the important ratios and second to create distinctiveness relative to competitors on at least one ratio. 

*Step 6:* The best ideas should be entered into the opportunity register, especially if they offer the potential for major improvements in productivity.

# Chapter 7 Selecting Your Competitive Terrain
At this point, another major competent of an entrepreneurial mindset kicks in- unrelenting focus. Entrepreneurs focus in two ways. First, they select only arenas from the competitive terrain that are attractive; then, they pursue only opportunities in the selected arena that allow them to strengthen their position.  *Focus means making trade-offs, including though choices to abandon or at least defer many possibilities, sometimes even to the point of dropping things that have historically been important to you.* Thus, you will look at the challenge of achieving focus from two perspectives. First, you’ll target attractive arenas in the competitive terrain, selecting those business arenas to compete in that represent your best chances fro profitable growth. Then you will decide on the priority of the opportunities in each of your selected arenas. /See detailed explanation and more examples in the book./

# Chapter 8 Assembling Your Opportunity Portfolio
By now you have gained an understanding of which business opportunities would make the most substantial contribution to the future for your organisation. The next challenge is to figure out how you are going to appropriately allocate resources to those opportunities that you elect to pursue. You’ll use an approach to building a portfolio of projects that draws on real options reasoning, in which you make investment with a limited downside to learn whether further investment is warranted. 

## Understanding Real Options Reasoning
Successful entrepreneurs approach investments in the creation of new businesses the way that investors might approach investing in stock options. To invest in stock options, you buy a contract that costs a small amount of money, relative to what it would cost to make an investment in the underlying security on which the option is written. The contract gives you the right, but not the obligation, to buy (or sell) the underlying asset on or before a specified date at a specific price. Should the deal not make financial sense when the option is due, you simply don’t invest. You then forfeit the cost of the option, but lose less than you would have if you had had to buy the underlying asset. The advantage of the option is that it preserves your claim on the opportunity without forcing you to make a commitment to it. 

In a similar vein, to explore new opportunities, you might make a limited-downside investment today in the hope of having access to an opportunity in the future. As with financial options, the greater the uncertainty with respect to the distribution of outcomes, the more the option is worth. See more examples and descriptions in Chapter 8.

# Chapter 9 Selecting And Executing Your Entry Strategy
## No sales until the “first five sales”
The starting point for designing your entry strategy is to identify a few seed customers fro each opportunity you seek to pursue. We ended chapter 8 by having you select a number of different initiatives with the potential to add significant value to your firm, whether they were ready for full-scale launch or not. For each of these, you should be able to identify one or more distinct customer segments. You should also be able to map a fairly accurate consumptions chain and link attributes of your offering to an attribute map for each segment. The challenge now is to go out there and secure a commitment to purchase from your first few target customers. 

We studied a small group of habitual entrepreneurs to see how they do this. One skill they seemed to possess was the ability to get customers to make some kind of commitment to a given set of attributes that they hoped to deliver, sometimes even before the product or service had been developed. These entrepreneurs see this commitment as affirmation of market acceptance of their new business model.  One goes so far as to say that if he does not have some kind of commitment from several key stakeholders, he won’t proceed, but will rather go back to his register and select another opportunity. 

The central challenge in creating that first set of customer transactions is zeroing in on those few customers on whom you can rely to get your business going. Be specific. When entrepreneurial wanna-bes come to us with business plans, we actually insist that before they even think about spending a dollar on assets or expenses, they provide us with the names of at least five customers with a demonstrated willingness to buy. If they can#t get a letter of intent, they should be able to get a written expression of interest. If they can’t even get an expression of interest from a living, breathing customer, they had better rethink their business model.

Where should you look for these all-important first few sets of customers? A logical place is to look to those you are already serving well and with whom you have built a good relationship. Often, though, the real beneficiaries of a project in your portfolio will be customers who are new to you-either because you are resegmenting a market or because you have achieved a breakthrough that will reconfigure the relations between players. In the latter case, the target segment doesn’t even exist yet.

*A good place to begin is with what are sometimes called lead-steer customers. Lead-steer customers are opinion leaders in their industry and/or are highly regarded by their peers. Corporations like those on the “most-admired” lists regularly published by the business press might qualify. Individuals who represent a segment that is highly desirable to you might do as well.*

## Testimonials and actual experiences with real customers are critical if buying from you involves any kind of perceived risk

In trying to sell to these customers, bear in mind that the buying decision may be complex. You should be so familiar with these customer’s consumption chains that you will have a good idea of how risky and difficult it will be for them to buy from you. How hard will it be for them to switch to your offering? How much will it cost them? If they need to learn to work with or operate your product or service, what is the training and adjustment burden? The greater the effort they must put into implementing your solution, the more you must convince them that the effort is worthwhile. 

You might find it helpful to prioritise potential customers according to the extent to which you believe they will generate substantial benefits by adopting your offering and to which they perceive it to be a risky, effortful move. Figure 9-1 shows the resulting matrix, which you can use to help set priorities. 

### Case Study with a Catalyst
Finally, in desperation, the entrepreneur called on an old college friend who was running an oil refinery for the Unilever Corporation. The entrepreneur brought with him the professor who had developed the catalyst and who could credibly attest to its safety and quality. He even volunteered to donate the first batch of catalyst at no cost, just so his friend could try it out. His friend was persuaded to make the order. The catalyst worked well, and Unilever made the switch. In this industry at the time, the Unilever plants set the standard for what was considered cutting edge. Once it became known that Unilever had adopted the product, nearly every other plant in the region switched over as well. 

The first sale led rapidly to the next few sales required. With momentum well established, the entrepreneur went on to convert the bulk of his target customer segment to the new catalyst within eighteen months. 

The most important deals, in short, are those that secure the critical first few sales.  You don not have sales of a thousand units until you have sold a hundred, and you can’t sell one hundred units until you have sold the first five. (We use the idiom “find the first five sales” to keep the idea fresh in people’s minds.) The front end of the initial marketing plan should focus on how to target customer for these first few sales and how to reduce their risk of purchase. 

# Onslaughts
An onslaughts is a direct, aggressive entry in a target arena. It typically involves a relatively expensive, high-commitment move to capture a significant position of the market for yourself. With an onslaught, you are hoping to capture an arena by establishing first-mover lockout, persuade incumbent competitors to withdraw, consolidate a fragmented industry, or at least deter competitors from expanding their presence. You will have accomplished your purpose when you succeed in deterring competitive entry or when existing competitors reduce their commitment to the target arena. 

*A well-known example of an onslaught occurred when Japanese semiconductor makers advanced on the Intel Corporation’s DRAM (dynamic random access memory) business in the mid-1980s. The Japanese firms used what they termed a 10 percent rule, which meant that they would cut prices on DRAMs for every target customer by 10 percent until Intel gave up on the customer. The eventual result of these cumulative attacks was Intel’s complete withdrawal from the DRAM market.*

If you are entrepreneur or a small player, aggressive onslaughts may do you as much harm as they do to the competition, because you will generally be more vulnerable to a sustained struggle and more likely to have to give up first. A more subtle alternative is the guerrilla campaign. 

## Guerrilla Campaigns
The objective of a guerrilla campaign is to build your position by moving into  an arena piecemeal, starting in one niche and then progressively expanding into other niches as your position consolidates. We use the term guerrilla because it calls to mind Mao Tse Tung’s admonition principles that topping a better-financed, larger, and entrenched opponent cannot be accomplished by means of conventional warfare. These principles emphasise fluid positions and dynamic thrusts and retreats. Thus, rather than seeking to dominate a mainstream market, a competitor using a guerrilla strategy might selectively sell to a niche, then abandon it if their activities should attract the attention of a major player. A smaller player can thus be much more flexible with respect to pricing and product modifications than a large player can afford to be. 

*The essence of the guerrilla campaign is to identify a niche in the market, preferably one that is underserved, and create a blockbuster attribute map for this niche that competitors will be reluctant to match.* This niche then serves as a guerrilla base from which you move into another niche, then another and so on. If you are able to identify such niches, you may avoid the highly costly alternative of a full onslaught on the target arena. Niches are particularly useful for new entrants because they tend to be less visible and less threatening than an onslaught. 

A classic example of a firm that pursued a guerrilla strategy is that of Progressive Insurance, described in Chapter 3, which moved into the high-risk niche in automobile insurance. This niche move was actually met with relief on the part of some competitors. This is characteristic of a great guerrilla strategy-if established competitors find your chosen niche difficult to serve or a poor fit with their capabilities, they are unlikely to do anything to stop your progress. For several years, Progressive built its capabilities. Eventually, the company used competences that evolved from serving its niche base to begin expanding into more attractive niches. Today, fully 15 percent of Progressive’s portfolio of customers are in the standard (i.e.  low-risk) segment, and the company ultimately hopes to mirror the industry at large, in which only 15-20 percent of all drives are in its initial nonstandard segment. 

An entire industry being reshaped by guerrilla competition is Internet business-to-business ecommerce. Many of the most promising of today’s Internet star-ups began by serving as distributors or access points from small customer segments. Customers in these segments have found that they can create a considerable scope when they consolidate their numbers globally, making serving their needs valuable for the first time. Thus, a segment that ordinarily would not be well served because it is too small can leverage low-cost Internet transactions to become a potentially valuable niche globally. 

### What makes a guerrilla campaign successful?
Respond “agree” or “disagree” with the following conditions.

_ Consumption chain and attribute analysis have uncovered an initial seed niche and follow-up niches that are poorly served by existing offerings. 

_ You are able to focus your initial effort on the seed niche.

_ You can rapidly achieve a decisive result in each of the target niches, which you can defend from later competition.

_ Customers in the niche are vocal about being underserved or overcharged. They have negative attributes to complain about, and nobody seems to be listening. 

_ Competitors are reluctant to match-particularly if matching means that they must extend the additional attributes to their entire market at great cost. 

_ Customers in the niche are willing to pay a premium if you meet their needs. 

Scoring: if you don’t have at least three “agree” responses, you should not even consider engaging in a guerrilla campaign, because you do not have the right conditions to be able to grow from your initial base. The more “agree” responses that you have beyond three, the more a guerrilla campaign might work. Before making the move, however you should validate the assumptions underlying your responses to the statements here and make sure that you have considered all relevant competitors, including those not currently engaged in the arena. 

One example of such a niche consists of laboratory scientists. Formerly, obtaining the sometimes esoteric chemicals that they require was an extremely  laborious process of hunting through voluminous catalogs and manuals that listed every chemical stocked by the supplier. The reason was that under a manual system, it was not cost-effective for speciality providers to tailor their catalogs to the needs of a given subset of scientists. Internet player Chemdex, however, has begun to address the needs for this underserved niche by allowing fast, accurate searching for chemicals on a web site that can be tailored specifically to the user community looking for materials. On the supply side, Chemdex can work with suppliers to obtain favourable pricing by consolidating many small orders into larger-volume buys. 

Anther example is Ebay. The company found a loyal following among collectors and other consumers who realised enormous benefits in being able to access a vast number of potential buyers for their goods; another benefit to customers benefit to customers was the time they could save in searching for items of interest. From this initial niche, Ebay seems poised to pursue ever more challenging and aggressive incursions into the mainstream; it has purchased high-end auctioneer Butter-field and Butterfield to reach the market for luxury goods more systematically. This move finally caught the attention of dominant incumbents and prompted a hurried alliance between upscale auctioneer Sotheby’s and Amazon.com

More about Feints, Gambits and other strategies see examples in the book. 

## Summary of Action Steps
*Step 1:* Identify the first few customers for your new business model (using the “first five sales” as a guiding principle). Determine the priority that you will give them, using the risk/benefit trade-offs depicted in figure 9-1.

*Step 2:* Articulate the strategy you will use to persuade them to begin transacting with you by mitigating any risks that they may anticipate. Make sure that you have clearly identified all the parties in the client organisation that will need to be positively involved in the purchase. 

*Step 3:* For each major customer arena that you intend to pursue, identify the major competitors that will be affected, as in table 9-1.
