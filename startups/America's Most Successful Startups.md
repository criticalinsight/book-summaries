# America's Most Successful Startups
#1 read/books/startup#

Writing on this book, the authors themselves had the opportunity to put some of these propositions into practice. The lessons were a tremendous inspiration for us but we also realized that they are very difficult to live. If the reader really wants to implement this advice, he must be ready to actively change his behavior.

## 2.1 Types of Opportunities

The first thing you need to build a company is an opportunity. Successful ventures are usually built on one of the following three types of opportunities.

### 2.1.1 Opportunities based on a Paradigm Shift
Opportunities based on a paradigm shift mean that opportunity exists because of both a new market and a new product. A paradigm shift is a fundamental change that changes the way people behave and business is done. Paradigms do not change every day and such fundamental changes probably occur only every 10 years. A paradigm shift usually creates a whole new industry and market. Examples for how a paradigm shift has created new industries are the semiconductor industry in the 70s, the personal computer industry in the 80s and the internet industry in the 90s.

Such new markets are often called evangelical markets, because in a paradigm shift the market is not yet existent and the early players have to develop the market. Thus companies that take advantage of a paradigm shift often enter untouched market space and there is little understanding of the market. Examples of such companies are Netscape and Amazon.com. The early companies in a new market face a tremendous challenge. They have to cause a behavior that does not exist today to come into existence and to become popular.

*Opportunities which are based on a paradigm shift are therefore very risky, but they also offer tremendous rewards.*

### 2.1.2 Opportunities based on a New Product or Business Model 

Compared with a paradigm shift, here opportunity exists because of a new product or new business model in an existing market. lt is very difficult to create a market from scratch such as in a paradigm shift, and indeed most successful companies in Silicon Valley are rather based on this concept of a new and successful product in an existing market. The most interesting existing markets are so-called *flash point markets*, meaning a market where you have pressure on two perspectives: There is a problem that is very pressing, painful, and when you inject a solution into that market, the market ignites. Suddenly there is a solution space and the product gets consumed in huge amounts because there bad been latent demand in the market. The importance of the need will determine the rate at which the new product is accepted. If the need it urgent, it will be a flash point market that ignites. If the need is less pressing it will be more of an evolutionary development.

### 2.1.3 Opportunities based on a Me-too Product

Here opportunity exists because of an existing but improved product in an existing market. The product is usually faster, cheaper or better. Successful me-too products are usually superior in an order of magnitude in one of these dimensions.


## 2.2 Opportunity Recognition

To find these kinds of opportunities you should Iook for markets that have some of the following characteristics.

### 2.2.1 Markets that change

If there is a single thing that gives you an opportunity to start a business, it is change. If everything stays the same, there is no room for a new company. Change is good. The more change, the better. To start a successful business you have to look for major shifts, so-called points of inflection. Otherwise all you can do is cheaper, faster, or better. Once you see the shift, the key is to understand what the market opportunity is. lt is not enough that the market is going through change, but the market, especially the customers themselves, need to be receptive to a change.

*Proposition: Look for an industry that is going through change and where the market is receptive to a change.*

### 2.2.2 Markets that are badly understood

There are large markets that are well understood and well served by able suppliers. There are small markets that are poorly understood and poorly served, but nobody cares, because they are small. The more well understood the markets are, the less the opportunity. The best opportunity is when you find a market that is large and is not well understood. New markets are often little understood. Sometimes, it can make sense to go into a very unsophisticated industry, where for instance the least number of MBAs are. These markets are often badly understood and you can bring in professional management and concepts from other more sophisticated industries.

*Proposition: Find a large market that is not well understood.*

### 2.2.3 Markets that are large
If the market opportunity is huge, the potential of your company is huge. If you do not have a significant market opportunity from day one, you are putting yourself into a small box.

/I used to live above a small pizzaria and I knew the guy who owned the place. He worked 12 hours a day, seven days a week. He was in there alt the time and worked so hard for his little restaurant. I realized one day that I have to work just as hard for a restaurant as I do it for a multi-billion dollar company. lf I have the choice, why not go for the big idea? (an Eslick, Silicon Spiee)/

Businesses have a natural scale. Keep that in mind when you choose an opportunity. Therefore you should try to visualise the size of the market you are playing in and the scale that the venture can achieve if it is successful. you can visualise that in advance. You will not get the size of the opportunity precisely, but you can get it in an order of magnitude: Is it a million dollar business, is it a hundred million dollar business or is it a multiple billion dollar business? One of the ways to figure out how big you can get is to Iook around at your potential competitors. If they are all in the multiple hundred millions of dollars, that tells you, if you are successful, you can be in the multiple hundred millions of dollars.

*Proposition: Choose a large market opportunity and check the scale of your competitors to visualize potential company size.*

Besides, you need to find a market where the gap between the degree to which the needs are met today and the size of the latent demand is large. The larger the gap between the degree to which its needs are met today and the size of the latent demand, the bigger the opportunity. Find that disparity in demand versus supply and figure out what can be done to address that gap.

*Proposition: Find a large market where there is a big gap between the degree to which its needs are met and the size of the potential demand.*

## 2.2.4 Markets that are fast growing
The market that you are looking for is not so much a large market that is fixed, but it has to be fast growing. The reason that fast growing markets are important is because by definition in a fast growing market there are lots of new decisions being made. The key is to become a participant in some of the new decisions that are made. In a market where there is growth and there are new decisions to be made you do not have to cause someone to stop doing business with their current company, or to throw out what they have already bought. When customers go out to buy more, they simply divide their new businesses.

lf you enter a market that is fixed in size and is not growing so that you getting an order means, in order for you to eat, you have to take food from me, you are going to have a much more aggressive fight for that food.

*Proposition: Find a fast growing market, because a fast growing market means a lot of new decisions will be made by the customers. Also a fast growing market allows more than one company to fourish and be successful.*

## 2.2.5 Markets where the Incumbent Players cannot move

Take a market where due to change new opportunities exist, which have not been exploited by the dominant players because of institutional resistance or other limiting factors on the existing Ieaders of the industry. So there is some reason why they cannot go after that opportunity. The following example illustrates this situation: Amazon can sell books online against Bames&Noble, because Bames&Noble cannot afford to charge less online than they do in the stores, and because the stores cost so much money to maintain, they cannot afford to go below certain price differentials. So Amazon can always have lower prices. Change creates these kinds of opportunity because for the incumbent players it is often very difficult to change what they do. Even though you might be smaller than the incumbent you have the advantage of starting over. Therefore you should Iook for an opportunity where the incumbent cannot move quickly enough. A situation where there is an entrenched competitor in the sense that there is a big Iabor problem, so that the incumbent cannot fire all these people, or in the sense that the incumbent has got capital investment that they have invested in and they cannot change. When such a situation occurs you can step in and over a certain period while the entrenched competitors have inertia to respond you can come in and steal a Iot of their
share.

*Proposition: Look for a market where change has created new opportunities which the incumbent players due to limiting factors cannot or not as fast take advantage of but which you can use because you start over again.*

## 2.2.6 Markets where there is little Competition

lt does not help you if you have a good idea and 20 other people have the same good idea. What happens is that people get ideas and they spread around really quickly. You have to Iook at your chances of succeeding not based just on what you are doing, but on the competitive environment. You just cannot assume that you are going to be better than the other 19 companies. Because you are not necessarily always smarter, or better financed or more experienced. Just take Electronic Commerce for instance, everybody is doing Electronic Commerce, it must be literally a thousand companies, though you know that only 20 or 30 are ever going to make any money. You really need a pretty free field initially, that does not have a Iot of competition. Free run is what it is sometimes called. Because it is tough to build a big company quickly if you have a lot of competitors for the same little emerging space, or if you are trying to sell against a really big competitor who is doing the same as you are. That is really tough. 

*Proposition: Choose an opportunity that does not have a Iot of competition. you have to Iook at your chances of succeeding not based just on the thing that you are doing, but also based on the competitive environment.*

## 2.3 Process of Opportunity Recognition

There are fundamentally two approaches to discover a business opportunity. One is a more intuitive process, the other an analytical approach.

### 2.3.1 Intuitive Approach

There are entrepreneurs who have a passion for something and out of that passion they develop a business. People who have built a business out of their hobby are for instance, Steve Jobs (Apple) and Bill Gates (Microsoft). You can tell if your are such an idea guy. If you have been writing down your ideas over the last two years, go back and look at these ideas and see how long it took someone else to come out with the same idea. If they came out with it within six months of you writing it down, it was not your idea. lt was not an original thought. Someone else already had thought of it and he was producing 18 months beforehand. If it took someone else 18 months to come up with this same idea, you are an idea guy.

### 2.3.2 Analytical Approach

There are other entrepreneurs who have built successful companies after they had gone through a rigorous analytical process in the search for an opportunity. Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com) and David Bobnett (Geocities) have developed their business ideas in a more analytical fashion. Both made lists of the kinds of businesses that would be business opportunities with the internet. They projected which of them had commercial potential. Both were very analytical in the process. Both were industry outsiders. One had a consulting background, the other had a background with an investment firm. Both were involved with computers and systems and came across the internet in 1994. None had anything to do with online communities or books before they started their company. Jeff Bezos for instance was sitting there working for an investment trading firm and the thing that was impressive to him was the growth of the internet. *It was growing at 2000% per month and he knew he wanted to do a business that was taking advantage of the internet.* And he asked himself what kind of businesses would really benefit from the internet. He just tried to rank order 30 different businesses. He did not know anything about books. But he felt that after really studying what the internet would truly enable that was different, that books just fitted it to a tee. So he went after it a big time.

## 2.4 Refinement Process

First, you should have a very clear idea of the opportunity. You need to answer the question why do you believe opportunity exists. The second question that you must answer is why does your product or service create value. It must have a compelling value proposition. So that when you go to a company you can say: *"If you buy this product, here is the value you get: in two years you can save 2 million dollar or in one year your sales will increase by so much in value."* The third is that you need to understand clearly why do you think you will win. What is your competitive advantage? If you cannot clearly articulate why you are going to beat the competition, you probably do not understand it. Then you are gambling.

You really need to research the idea until you can clearly articulate the answers to these questions. Because once you can answer these questions, you will end up with a business that is based on a very well understood reason for existence. You will then know why it exists. And that will then help you write the business plan. And you will be able to tell the story to the people you need to hire and they will say, it all makes sense, I want to work with you, and then they will advance that vision, because they understood it, and they will be able to know what to do. It is a cycle of doing things for the right reason.

*Proposition: You need to research the idea until you can clearly articulate your business. You need to be able to answer the question why there an opportunity exists, how your business creates value and why you can do it better than anyone else.*

## 2.5 Research Process

When you have discovered an opportunity you should then go to research it. To learn about industries, you should go to the library and read trade journals. And if you spend a couple of days, sometimes a couple of weeks, reading the back issues of trade journals in sequence you can learn everything about an industry and what is going on in that industry. That is where you get your initial background information from. Learn and understand the economic drivers of the industry, and how the value chain works and where your company fits into it. Then go and talk to people in the industry and call them up. For instance the authors of the articles that you read. Tell them you read their article, that it did not make any sense to you, but that this idea makes sense to you. Challenge them and test your ideas on them. You need to ask them: "What do you think of that, would you buy that, how would you change that?" And they will say: "Talk to this person." And then you go and talk to that person.

You should be very open with your idea. Do not be worried about someone stealing your idea. You should be worried more about whether your idea is stupid. Just say to people "This is my idea, what do you think about it?". You will get a Iot more value out of using their intelligence to clarify your idea, to get their piece to the puzzle than keeping the idea to yourself. In fact, everyone has a little piece of the big puzzle. Everybody will understand it from his perspective, and you will end up with many different views and a broad perspective. There is even a theoretical concept for that. According to the surface theory, it makes sense to create a large surface i.e. to make your idea broadly known so that you get a Iot of input from people and people start to associate you with a certain topic and will refer

*Proposition: Be open with your idea. Chances are that it is a stupid idea.*

*lt is at least a six-month process to come up with an idea and get it to the point where you are ready to ask somebody else to start working on it.* In these six months, you need to research exactly what you want to do, what the hurdles are, whether they are technical, legal, financial or whatever, and how you want to break the building of the company down into stages.

*There is often a Iot of pressure on you when you are searching for an opportunity.* Everybody is going to ask you all the time: "When are you going to start, what business are you going to start, why do you want to choose that one?" Take enough time to pick the idea. You do not want to be pressured to pick an idea until you really believe it is the right one. lt will take a Iot of patience.

*Proposition: Take enough time to pick and articulate the idea. Do not put yourself under pressure neither from yourself nor from others.*

_If you have a job or are at school it sometimes makes it easier to Iook for an idea, because you might feel less pressure and thus are less likely to jump in on an idea._ At the same time, however, you have less time to Iook for an idea and to concentrate on researching it. Therefore sometimes it can make sense to go on a sabbatical. You should take a long vacation, start to surf the internet, talk to a Iot of people, and have long business lunches. Important is that you do not Iet yourself be pressured to pick an idea.

Another way is to research always two ideas at the same time. Because if you just research one idea you have a tendency to make it look good. If you are researching two at a time you always compare them. And you end up picking the best one. And then you get another one and compare them again. You are constantly refining the best one while looking for reasons why this idea is still better than idea number 4 and 5. Often this is better than focusing all your creativity on one idea and trying to force an idea to Iook like a success.

## 2.6 General Advice on the Idea Generation Process

Opportunities are in most cases a function of identifying a need. The type of idea that you are looking for should start with understanding a market need. If there is a need in a market and you can embrace and understand that, then you will have what Ieads to an inspiration. And make sure that this need is broad enough in scope. And that the solution is going to be unique enough that it allows you to benefit from the solution for a reasonable time frame. And it has to be doable within a reasonable time frame with a reasonable amount of money. The more you can think like a consumer, a user, addressing certain problems the better chance you have of creating something new, compelling, and useful that solves a need.

*Proposition: Build your idea on a market need.*

Whenever opportunity exists, because you are taking advantage of a regulatory environment, you should be very careful. You always need to ask yourself what else you can you do to create long-term competitive advantage. Because if your business is only focused on that regulatory advantage, the moment the regulatory advantage goes away, you are done. Therefore do not count on regulation to drive your business. Also do not
build your business on fuzzy topics as for instance environmentalism, but on fundamental economics. 

*Proposition: Never rely solely on a regulatory environment for an advantage, because it can change. Build the foundation for long-term business success on fundamental economics.*

Do not start a business where you can Iook out five years and you can realistically anticipate a fundamental change in the business e.g. a deregulation. It is a dangerous strategy if you think you can build up the business fast enough and harvest it before that happens. You do not get so much done in five years. It takes a long time to get people and structure ready. Often you are overly optimistic with regard to how long it takes to build a business. Therefore even if you see a huge opportunity for the next five years, be careful and often it is better to walk away from that.

*Proposition: Be wary of businesses where you can realistically anticipate a fundamental change in the business in the next five years.*

Sometimes you are in a market where for you to be successful requires that other companies are successful. There might be things that have to happen for everything to work and if something gets out of timing or does not happen, you will not be successful, because as it is not going to happen the market or the product will not be created. You need to realize that in order to create a new market or just a new product, you might need other companies as for instance your suppliers to create the necessary technologies. For example, when a company called Slate tried to create a new market in pen computing in the beginning of the 1990s it failed, because it succeeded to develop a software, but the operating systems were not there and the hardware vendors would not make the commitment to volume shipping. You should therefore never forget that you might depend on other companies and other things that have to happen for you to be successful, that you cannot control, or that do not only depend on your company entirely. You cannot control other companies.

*Proposition: Your success might depend on other players that surround you and which you cannot control. Watch the players that you depend on.*

Anybody can start a company. To be a successful entrepreneur, you do not have to come up with your own ideas. Y ou have to recognize great ideas when you see them. It has nothing to do with having the technology in your packet first. The issue is whether you can recognize the opportunity and convince the technology-guys to join you. You do not have to have the unique technological idea yourself. The ability to identify the opportunity, to clearly articulate the benefits and to bring the team together makes you an
entrepreneur.

*Proposition: Recognizing the opportunity is more important than having the solution in your pocket.*

Details, even the product and distribution details, will evolve over time, during the months as you are talking to potential partners and investors. These facets of the business idea will go through a transformation and refinement process. However you need to have the core idea and vision in the beginning that drives your efforts and gives you focus.

*Proposition: Many details will evolve over time, but you need to have a clear idea and be able to articulate your vision.*

Also you need to do it the right way. Do not bum bridges, do not steal ideas, do not use the resources of another company, and quit your job before you start working on the new thing. Otherwise you will cause problems for years down the road.

*Proposition: Do not steal ideas and pay attention to the terms of your employment contract.*

Last but not least, you need to find an industry that you really enjoy, because an environment that you really enjoy will stimulate your creativity and ultimately make you successful.

*Proposition: Go into an industry that you enjoy.*

## 2.7 Evaluation of a Business Idea
/I feel like I am revealing a professional secret. I play a little game with myself when I read a business plan for the first time. I give myself fifteen minutes to find the fatal flaw, the problem in the business. I try to think what could go wrong, why is it not going to work. I think about basics when I try to find the fatal flaw. Is there really an opportunity, is there really some need that 's out there that this product or service is going to fulfil or is this some fantasy? Is there really a market for it?/

## 3. The Homework
Once you have recognised the opportunity you should do some serious homework before launching your business.

## 3.1 Defining the Market Need

First and foremost, you should spend a tremendous amount of time clearly understanding the customer needs. *The first six months you should just talk to customers trying to understand their need and to validate your idea.* Once you understand the need, it is then a Iot easier to explore technology and design a product. Many startups burn through a Iot of cash with a product or technology searching for a solution. They start building technologies and then later on they realize that not all of them are aligned to the right markets or needs. Market research is therefore the crucial reality check, which validates your idea and makes sure that you build the product to market needs, instead of following an "If we build it, they will come" attitude. The importance of market research cannot be overemphasized.

/I would rather take more time for take-off and get my plane off the ground so that once off the ground I know where I am heading towards, than being the first one to take off, without knowing where I am going and in that process trying to go three orJour ways. It is much better to do all the planning and thinking before. As an entrepreneur you are impatient. But your impatience should be as much trying to understand customer needs first and understanding them well, than your impatience of saying:" I am going to do something". (Magnifi, Ranjan Sinha)/

lt is really important to see that the clearer you understand the needs, the clearer you will be able to focus your team, and the clearer you will able to set your priorities, because in a startup you have to say "No" to nine out of ten things.

*Proposition: Spend a tremendous amount of time and effort on market research. Understanding clearly customer needs is the key to success.*

Talking to customers is the most essential part of the homework because it is the single most important way for checking on an idea and finding out if it is real. Only talking to customers reduces market risk, which is the most difficult risk to address. Market risk describes the uncertainty whether customers will be willing to buy your product. Talking with customers allows you to test your idea and to improve it and thus reduces market risk, which makes your venture more attractive to investors and ensures you a higher valuation since it reduces the likelihood of failure of your venture tremendously.

When talking to potential customers about the product, you almost have to simulate selling it to them already. You have to find the people you think would be the buyers for that product. And then you have to get the idea flashed out enough to pitch it as a product. So you need to say to people: "*Here is what it would be, here is what it would do, here is how much you would have to pay for it, would you buy a product like that?"*

Talking to customers is so important, that venture capitalists sometimes even get on a plane with the entrepreneur to meet potential customers. There they pretend to sell the product to them. They tell them that they are developing a product, describe the features of the product to them and Iisten to their reactions to it. Once they have talked with 20 or 30 people, they are going to have a pretty good feel for whether or not the product that the entrepreneur contemplates is going to fill a market need or not.

It is amazing how rarely this is done by entrepreneurs, though it is the most important thing, and it is really easy to do. You do not have to spend a Iot of money on expensive marketing studies. Usually, five customers is enough. If you find five people you think should be interested based on your concept and you show your prototype to them and they really want it, the idea is real. They better really want it, because it is not enough that they think it is kind of a good idea. But if five people really want it you are probably onto something. If one or two or three people kind of do not understand, there are two possibilities: one is that it is not a good idea, the other is that you are not presenting it in a very coherent way so that they cannot understand. But do not go back to those customers, find five new customers.

/Our experience here as we test new products is Jour to Jive customers tell us all we want to know. We know if it's going to fly or not. You need almost unanimous consent from your targeted customers. The reason is that if you can't identify the group of people who need the product enough to give a "yes" when they don't even really have to put the money out of their pocket, then you do not have identified the customer for this product. (Nico Nierenberg, Actuate Software)/

*Proposition: There is nothing like talking to customers. It is the single most important part of your homework to tell if your idea is real.*

In your conversations with potential customers you should try to see if there is a problem or not, and explain your product. In this process new problems will emerge and your problems will get validated or not and the need you perceived will get more focused. These conversations with potential customers are not to get the first design partners or your first customers. This exercise is only to see how acute the problem is and determine whether it is a there headache or a serious problem into which the customer is ready to put millions of dollars to solve it. You have to find out whether the customer can live without your solution or if it is a mission-critical problem. Within that process you will come across an element of the problem that is mission-critical. And that is where you should focus your efforts towards and what you should try to solve. It is crucial to find a mission-critical problem. And that may be small initially to really focus on and build a technology to solve that one mission-critical problem. But then you get the customer’s confidence. And you will spend time with the customer and begin to understand their other needs.

In terms of the process, the first few months are therefore just an exploration of the need without saying I have a solution or I can have a solution. Instead, you need to refine the problem to a point that it is mission-critical. If possible, the product needs to become a “must-have", a so-called painkiller, not just a "nice-to-have", a so-called vitamin. *If it is a "must-have" product you have a killer. If it is a "nice-to-have" you potentially have a winner.* Only after this exploration of the customer need, you should start to assemble technologies and prototype the product.

*Proposition: Explore the customer need through conversations with the customer and refine the problem to a point that it is a mission-critical problem. Then assemble what it needs to build a solution.*

/The customer segment we are going after has changed. As a startup we were full of energy and we had all these dreams in our mind. We will be able to change the world, instead of taking them three years to adopt a new architecture, we will be able to get them adopt an architecture in six months. We believed in our dreams. But the fact is that we did not get them to make the decision about the architecture in six months. (Nimish Shah, Sentient Networks)/

Changing customer behaviour is not easy because the problems that your product is addressing did not just spring into existence yesterday. Your customers have been dealing with them one way or another for a while, and you must compete with whatever method they are currently using. The hardest sell may be when they are currently doing nothing. After all, doing nothing does not require writing checks, and whatever you are offering to them probably does.

*Proposition: Do your homework on customer behavior. Do not believe that you can change customer behavior easily.*

## 3.2 Defining the Customer

In your market research you have to find out who is going to buy your product. The customers you at first thought must buy your product, need not to be the ones who end up buying it. You must ask yourself who is the specific, well-defined customer who will buy your product. For instance, it is not enough to say that companies will buy it, because you cannot sell dog food to dogs, dogs do not buy dog food, people buy dog food, and they feed it to their dogs. Companies do not buy products, people buy products. A Iot of startups come up with ideas, they present them and they say: "The reason why we are going to make a Iot of money is that every company has the following problem.” The problem with that is that corporations do not buy products, people in corporations buy products. A much better statement is therefore "there is a systems administrator at every company who has this problem". That really means "defining your customer". So you need to know who the exact buyer in the company is, whether it is the technical person, the finance person, or the marketing person. *Also you need to know who the user is. User and buyer are often not the same.* Once you have defined the exact customer, you have to think how to make money with your product and you have to Iook back again at your product. All the elements need to fit. The way you deliver it, the way you price it, the way that you design it, the features and functions all need to point to that common thing, the customer.

*Proposition: You need to be able to name and describe the exact customer of your product.*

## 3.3 Defining the Market Size

To determine the size of the market, you need to go to potential customers and try to find out what they would pay for your product. This sounds easier than it is, because if the product is new most people have no idea what you are talking about. Especially if you are exposing people to something that does not exist, it is very difficult for people to imagine. Therefore speak to some early adopter customers who have a good sense for what things may be attractive. Besides, you need to build a prototype while keeping your costs low. Build a demo of what you are talking about. Thus you will give your potential customers something to look at and to "smell" your product. There are many inexpensive ways to build prototypes. With this prototype you try to find out what people pay. Also find out what other players in the industry charge for similar products and what their revenue model look like. Then you start to model your pricing and revenue model. If your typical profile of a customer is this, multiply the number of customers with that profile and you are beginning to get the total available market. This is not rocket science. The fact is that you will never get real numbers. Often there is no complete data. One of the first things an entrepreneur learns to work with is incomplete data. You will never have perfect information so do not wait for that. You will never get a straight answer. You have to bet to your weaknesses. Entrepreneurs place bets - high value, high risk, high returns.

## 3.4 Defining the Market Timing
One of the most important success factors is whether the market is ready for what you will give him. You cannot be way out there. If you are way out there you are creating a market for somebody else, because by the time the market gets where you are now, you will be dead or your equity stake will be diluted completely. Besides, it will be very difficult to motivate your people. You have to be ahead of the curve by a short period of time. You should therefore ask yourself if the market is ready for the product: "Am I too far ahead of the market? Am I a year or two or even three years too early and if I am how do I manage my cash reserves so that I am there when the market breaks?" In order to determine whether the market is ready you need to speak to many potential customers. But you should not only test on the most advanced because they may as well be way too far ahead of the rest of the market. They are often not representative. Do not get caught by the glamour, but test on the average as well. Then you might be able to tell for instance that the world is not yet ready for your final product, but that it is ready for the first step towards your real product. In that case you should start with a small, maybe not yet so sophisticated product knowing that the market is not yet ready for the big product.

If you are ahead of the market and you are waiting for the market to catch up with you, you will need staying power. You have to keep company size and company salaries very small and build up a core competency that no one else has. This core competence will be critical when the market starts to develop.

*Proposition: Do not be too early, nor too late in the market. Be ahead of the curve by a short period of time.*

You should always go and associate with the best companies, w-here you can learn the most. The first entrepreneurial activity is often a great learning experience because nobody really knows what a startup is, unless they have been involved in one. _You should be spending some years in gradually smaller environments to learn the dynamics of markets and company development that you need to know. And eventually you should try to gain experience in another startup before you start your own and make mistakes when you are still an employee._

## 24. The First Customers

The first customers really make a difference. lt is the ultimate test that people are willing to pay money for your product. Early customers are like early employees. To win those customers you should try whatever it takes. Often people are uncomfortable buying from a startup because no one
wants to buy a million dollar worth of equipment from a company he has never heard of. No one wants to be the first one. To the first customers you will be selling yourself as much as the product. The first customers are taking a risk buying the product from you. They are actually investing in the company. They take a risk with you and should therefore be considered as the most precious partners. They provide the first test of your product in the real world. /The very first customers have a very special place in my heart. (Pamela Reeve, Lightbridge)/

The very first customers are especially important because they are your customers of reference. They will provide you with reference ability and set the foundation to get the momentum going. Because these customers will provide instant credibility to your solution, validate your idea and thus provide enormous leverage for your efforts to gain more customers. Then it will be very clear to the market where your product fits, what it does, and what category it fits into.

*Proposition: The first customers provide you with the all-important references for our sales efforts. Nothing sells better than proven customer success.*

Besides early customers can provide tremendous input during the development phase already. The goal should be to have a very close relationship between the development team and the user, so that you can meet their requirements. There is really nothing like building your product closely with some prospective customer. They are spending their time, their energy, and they are giving you feedback already for the prototype. Also, they are testing your product by integrating it into their infrastructure.

*Proposition: There is nothing Iike building your product with a customer.*

Before moving on to other customers you should really focus on these first key customers and make sure that you have really done it well. Then you will know that you have the right product for the right solution. After that, you can go out and get more customers.

*Proposition: Focus all your efforts to satisfy the first 20% (early adopters) of the market segment. The others will follow.*

In addition, the first customers will have a significant influence on your valuation. If you can, you should bootstrap to the point where you get your first customers and then go and raise the money. Because at that point there is no question whether the dogs will eat the dog food. And with the dogs eating the dog food you will get a better valuation.

When you come out with a product, people need a handle, a place, a segment, a box, ultimately a category to put you in. Otherwise they will not even want to talk about your product, because they do not understand what it is. They have to compare you to something: "What is it like? How is it different from that other ... ?" You have to make very sure that they put your product into the right category. Once people have put you into a certain category it will be very difficult to get out of that category again. This is a tremendous challenge when you ship your product for the first time. Often startup companies are building something new and it does not fit into an existing category. Then you will have to create and develop the market category that really defines you as a company. If you create a new category, you have to create in a way that it is immediately understandable and intuitive. If you succeed you will be identified with this category and others will have to follow you. Creating a new category will usually put you at a competitive advantage and establish you as the Ieader.

*Proposition: Positioning is very important. You need to make sure that you are put into the right category or create a category yourself. Make it clear to the market what you do, what your category is, and that you are the Ieader in that category.*

Since the first customers are strategically very important, you have to choose carefully who you should go after as your first customers. You should figure out early who are going to be the major influencers in your market segment and out of these you should go for the early adopters first, the visionary customers. You should get what is called "lighthouse accounts". Customer that stand out like a lighthouse, everybody sees them. If you can get these accounts and make them happy, the rest of the industry will follow. You should do whatever you can to get a good reference with them. You really treat them like kings and give them great service. Industries are often very small and everybody knows everybody else. Potential customers will call up your reference customers. You really want people to speak about you and by making your "lighthouse accounts" happy, you will have laid the foundation for future growth. /Being able to get into Intel and IBM as No. I and 2, was a major breakthrough. We try to bring technology to the market with the Ieader which then triggers the rest of the market. (William Elder, Genus)/

*Proposition: Get "lighthouse-accounts" as first customers. Among the industry Ieaders focus on the early adopters.*

In order to win such a high-profile customer, depending on the market situation you should choose one of the following two strategies: One strategy is to go for a very high-profile first customer. Then you will have to put everything you have into it, knowing that if you fail, you probably ruined your chance to start again. The other approach is to take a medium or low-end customer, work out the bugs, and then go after the high-profile customers. The decision which of these strategies you should follow depends on where you think the market is in its development, how fast you have to attack it, how much time you have got left and how big your window of opportunity is. If the window is small you should definitely go to the high-profile customer directly. Probably somebody else is right behind you and has also more resources than you have. If the window is large you can try to work out the bugs with a medium-end customer and then go for a high-profile customer.

*Proposition: When the window of opportunity is large first go to a medium-end customer. If the window of opportunity is small go to the high-profile customer directly.*
