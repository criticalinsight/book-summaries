[Principles by Ray Dalio](https://www.principles.com/)

Principles are concepts that can be applied over and over again in similar circumstances as distinct from narrow answers to specific questions. Every game has principles that successful players master to achieve winning results. So does life. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with the laws of nature or the laws of life. 

Creating a great culture, finding the right people, managing them to do great things, and solving problems creatively and systematically are challenges faced by all organizations. What differentiates them is how they approach these challenges. The principles laid out in the pages that follow convey our unique ways of doing these things, which are the reasons for our unique results. 

I saw the people who I cared about most struggling with problems and wanted to help them; I also found that their problems were almost always the result of violating one or more of these principles, and that their problems could be solved by applying these principles. 

## I also believe that nothing is certain. I believe that the best we can hope for is highly probable.

## So, when digesting each principle, please ask yourself: “Is it true?

People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don’t will suffer through constant misunderstanding and conflicts with one another.

### The consensus is often wrong, so I have to be an independent thinker.
To make any money, you have to be right when they’re wrong.

I want you to work for yourself, to come up with independent opinions, to stress-test them, to be wary about being overconfident, and to reflect on the consequences of your decisions and constantly improve.

Through this time and ‘til now I followed the same basic approach I used as a 12-year-old caddie trying to beat the market, i.e., by 1) working for what I wanted, not for what others wanted me to do; 2) coming up with the best independent opinions I could muster to move toward my goals; 3) stress-testing my opinions by having the smartest people I could find challenge them so I could find out where I was wrong; 4) being wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing; and 5) wrestling with reality, experiencing the results of my decisions, and reflecting on what I did to produce them so that I could improve.

## I learned that failure is by and large due to not accepting and successfully dealing with the realities of life, and that achieving success is simply a matter of accepting and successfully dealing with all my realities.

I met a number of great people and learned that none of them were born great—they all made lots of mistakes and had lots weaknesses—and that great people become great by looking at their mistakes and weaknesses and figuring out how to get around them. In short, I learned that being totally truthful, especially about mistakes and weaknesses, led to a rapid rate of improvement and movement toward what I wanted.

The people who really change the world are the ones who see what’s possible and figure out how to make that happen. *I believe that dreamers who simply imagine things that would be nice but are not possible don’t sufficiently appreciate the laws of the universe to understand the true implications of their desires, much less how to achieve them.*


For example, communism was a system created by people with good intentions who failed to recognize that their idealistic system was inconsistent with human nature. As a result, they caused more harm than good.

# This perspective gives me a non-traditional sense of good and bad: “good,” to me, means operating consistently with the natural laws, while “bad” means operating inconsistently with these laws. In other words, for something to be “good” it must be grounded in reality. And if something is in conflict with reality—for example, if morality is in conflict with reality—it is “bad,” i.e., it will not produce good outcomes.
I believe that evolution, which is the natural movement toward better adaptation, is the greatest single force in the universe, and that it is good. It is good because evolution is the process of adaptation that leads to improvement.

It is natural that it should be this way—i.e., that our lives are not satisfied by obtaining our goals, but rather by striving for them—because of the law of diminishing returns. For example, suppose making a lot of money is your goal and suppose you make enough so that making more has no marginal utility. Then it would be foolish to continue to have making money be your goal.

1) seeking new things (goals); 2) working and learning in the process of pursuing these goals; 3) obtaining these goals; and 4) then doing this over and over again is the personal evolutionary process that fulfills most of us and moves society forward.

There are many people who have made a lot of money who never made making a lot of money their primary goal. Instead, they simply engaged in the work that they were doing, produced what society wanted, and got rich doing it. *And there are many people who really wanted to make a lot of money but never produced what the society wanted and they didn’t make a lot of money.*

That is why some of the most successful people are typically those who see the changing landscape and identify how to best adapt to it. However, what differentiates man from other species is man’s greater ability to learn. Because we can learn, we can evolve more and faster than other species.

For example, /highly creative, goal-oriented people/ who are good at imagining the big picture often can easily get tripped up on the details of daily life, while /highly pragmatic/, task-oriented people who are great with the details might not be creative. That is because the ways their minds work make it difficult for them to see both ways of thinking. In nature everything was made for a purpose, and so too were these different ways of thinking. 

## The most important quality that differentiates successful people from unsuccessful people is our capacity to learn and adapt to these things.
We aren’t born with the ability to make good decisions; we learn it.

## Reality + Dreams + Determination = A Successful Life

So, the quality of our lives depends on the quality of the decisions we make . 


It is a fundamental law of nature that to evolve one has to push one’s limits, which is painful, in order to gain strength—whether it’s in the form of lifting weights, facing problems head-on, or in any other way

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2011.49.36.png)

Those who react well to pain that stands in the way of getting to their goals—those who understand what is causing it and how to deal with it so that it can be disposed of as a barrier—gain strength and satisfaction. This is because most learning comes from making mistakes, reflecting on the causes of the mistakes, and learning what to do differently in the future. 

## Pain + Reflection = Progress

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2011.51.59.png)

However, by not facing these harsh realities, they don’t find ways of properly dealing with them. And because their decisions are not based in reality, they can’t anticipate the consequences of their decisions. 

In contrast, people who know that understanding what is real is the first step toward optimally dealing with it make better decisions.

# Ask yourself, “Is it true?”

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2011.53.15.png)

People who worry about looking good typically hide what they don’t know and hide their weaknesses, so they never learn how to properly deal with them and these weaknesses remain impediments in the future.
*people who are interested in making the best possible decisions rarely are confident that they have the best possible answers.*

I do know that I have created compensating approaches so that what I am bad at doesn’t hurt me much; e.g., I surround myself with people who have good rote memories who do the things that I am bad at, and I carry around tools like my BlackBerry.

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2011.56.32.png)

People who overweigh the first-order consequences of their decisions and ignore the effects that the second- and subsequent-order consequences will have on their goals rarely reach their goals.


![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2011.58.44.png)

Successful people understand that bad things come at everyone and that it is their responsibility to make their lives what they want them to be by successfully dealing with whatever challenges they face.

/How much do you let yourself off the hook rather than hold yourself accountable for your success?/

## However, because of the law of nature that pushing your boundaries will make you stronger, which will lead to improved results that will motivate you, the more you operate in your “stretch zone,” the more you adapt and the less character it takes to operate at the higher level of performance. So, if you don’t let up on yourself, i.e., if you operate with the same level of “pain,” you will naturally evolve at an accelerating pace.

- - - -
Those who are the most successful are capable of “higher level thinking” —i.e., they are able to step back and design a “machine” consisting of the right people doing the right things to get what they want.

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-02-28%20at%2012.02.41.png)

That schematic is meant to convey that your goals will determine the “machine” that you create to achieve them; that machine will produce outcomes that you should compare with your goals to judge how your machine is working. Your “machine” will consist of the design and people you choose to achieve the goals.

## If your outcomes are inconsistent with your goals (e.g., if you are having problems), you need to modify your “machine,” which means that you either have to modify your design/culture or modify your people.

I call it “higher level thinking” because your perspective is that of one who is looking down on at your machine and yourself objectively , using the feedback loop as I previously described. In other words, your most important role is to step back and design, operate and improve your “machine” to get what you want.

Think of it as though there are two yous—you as the designer and overseer of the plan to achieve your goals (let’s call that one you(1)) and you as one of the participants in pursuing that mission (which we will call you(2)). You(2) is a resource that you(1) have to get what you(1) want, but by no means your only resource. To be successful you(1) have to be objective about you(2).

Let’s imagine that your goal is to have a winning basketball team. Wouldn’t it be silly to put yourself in a position that you don’t play well? If you did, you wouldn’t get what you want. Whatever your goals are, achieving them works the same way.

_If you(1) see that you(2) are not capable of doing something, it is only sensible for you(1) to have someone else do it. In other words, you(1) should look down at you(2) and all the other resources at your(1) disposal and create a “machine” to achieve your(1) goals, remembering that you(1) don’t necessarily need to do anything other than to design and manage the machine to get what you(1) want. If you(1) find that you(2) can’t do something well, fire yourself (2) and get a good replacement! You shouldn’t be upset that you found out that you(2) are bad at that—you(1) should be happy because you(1) have improved your(1) chances of getting what you(1) want. If you(1) are disappointed because you(2) can’t be the best person to do everything, you(1) are terribly naïve because nobody can do everything well._

# The biggest mistake most people make is to not see themselves and others objectively. 

## In other words, “The Process” consists of five distinct steps:

1. Have clear goals.
2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of achieving your goals.
3. Accurately diagnose these problems.
4. Design plans that explicitly lay out tasks that will get you around your problems and on to your goals.
5. Implement these plans—i.e., do these tasks.
You need to do all of these steps well in order to be successful.

*Treat your life like a game or a martial art.* Your mission is to figure out how to get around your challenges to get to your goals. In the process of playing the game or practicing this martial art, you will become more skilled. As you get better, you will progress to ever-higher levels of the game that will require—and teach you—greater skills. I will explain what these skills are in the next section. However, the big and really great news is that you don’t need to have all of these skills to succeed! You just have to 1) know they are needed; 2) know you don’t have some of them; and 3) figure out how to get them (i.e., either learn them or work with others who have them).

## By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn’t give a damn what you “like.” 

Mistakes are inevitable, and it’s important to recognize and accept this fact of life. The good news, as I have mentioned, is that most learning comes through making mistakes—so there is no end to learning how to play the game better. You will have an enormous number of decisions to make, so no matter how many mistakes you make, *there will be plenty of opportunities to build a track record of success.*

## 1) Setting Goals
The first, most important, and typically most difficult step in the 5-Step Process is setting goals. This is the step where you face the fundamental limit: life is like a giant smorgasbord of more delicious alternatives than you can ever hope to taste. So you have to reject having some things you want in order to get other things you want more. Put another way, *to achieve your goals you have to prioritise, and that includes rejecting good alternatives.* Goals are the things that you really want to achieve, while desires are things you want that can prevent you from reaching your goals. So, in terms of the consequences they produce, goals (physical fitness) are good and desires (unhealthy food) are bad.

*Avoid setting goals based on what you think you can achieve.* You need to set goals without yet assessing whether or not you can achieve them. You really can achieve virtually anything, even if you don’t know how you will do it at that moment. And as I don’t limit my goals to what seems attainable at the moment I set them, the goals I set tend to be higher than they would otherwise be.
Generally speaking, goal setting is best done by those who are good at big-picture conceptual thinking, synthesizing, visualizing, and prioritizing. 

*In summary, in order to get what you want, the first step is to really know what you want, without confusing goals with desires, and without limiting yourself because of some imagined impediments that you haven’t thoroughly analyzed.*

## 2) Identifying and Not Tolerating Problems
After you set your goals, you must come up with a plan or a design to achieve them and then you must execute that plan by doing the tasks. On the way to achieving your goals and executing your design, you will encounter problems that have to be diagnosed, so that the design can be modified to get around these obstacles. *That’s why you need to identify and not tolerate problems.*

*The more painful the problem, the louder it is screaming.44 In order to be successful, you have to 1) perceive problems and 2) not tolerate them.*

/If you don’t identify your problems, you won’t solve them, so you won’t move forward toward achieving your goals./ As a result, it is essential to bring problems to the surface.

When identifying problems, it is important to remain centered and logical. *While it can be tempting to react emotionally to problems and seek sympathy or blame others, this accomplishes nothing.*

Remember that identifying problems is like finding gems embedded in puzzles: if you solve the puzzles you will get the gems that will make your life much better.
*Don’t confuse problems with causes.* “I can’t get enough sleep” is not a problem, it is a cause of some problem. 

*Once you identify your problems, you must not tolerate them.* Tolerating problems has the same result as not identifying them (i.e., both stand in the way of getting past the problem), but the root causes are different

*Remember that you need to do each step independently from the other steps before moving on.* Can you comfortably identify your problems without thinking about how to solve them? It is a good exercise to just make a list of them, without possible solutions. Only after you have created a clear picture of your problems should you go to the next step.

## 3) Diagnosing the Problems

*You will be much more effective if you focus on diagnosis and design rather than jumping to solutions.*  It is a very common mistake for people to move directly from identifying a tough problem to a proposed solution in a nanosecond without spending the hours required to properly diagnose and design a solution. This typically yields bad decisions that don’t alleviate the problem. *Diagnosing and designing are what spark strategic thinking.*

*You must be calm and logical.* When diagnosing problems, as when identifying problems, reacting emotionally, though sometimes difficult to avoid, can undermine your effectiveness as a decision-maker. By contrast, staying rational will serve you well.

*You must get at the root causes.* Root causes, like principles, are things that manifest themselves over and over again as the deep-seated reasons behind the actions that cause problems. Identifying the real root causes of your problems is essential because you can eliminate your problems only by removing their root causes. In other words, you must understand, accept, and successfully deal with reality in order to move toward your goals.

*Recognizing and learning from one’s mistakes and the mistakes of others who affect outcomes is critical to eliminating problems.* Many problems are caused by people’s mistakes. But people often find it difficult to identify and accept their own mistakes.

More than anything else, what differentiates people who live up to their potential from those who don’t is a willingness to look at themselves and others objectively.

I call the pain that comes from looking at yourself and others objectively “growing pains,” because it is the pain that accompanies personal growth. No pain, no gain. Of course, anyone who really understands that no one is perfect and that these discoveries are essential for personal growth finds that these discoveries elicit “growing pleasures.”

## Pain + Reflection = Progress

Much as you might wish this were not so, this is a reality that you should just accept and deal with. There is no get- ting around the fact that achieving success requires getting at the root causes of all important problems, and people’s mistakes and weaknesses are sometimes the root causes. So *to be successful, you must be willing to look at your own behavior and the behavior of others as possible causes of problems.*

*The most important qualities for successfully diagnosing problems are logic, the ability to see multiple possibilities, and the willingness to touch people’s nerves to overcome the ego barriers that stand in the way of truth.*

## 4) Designing the Plan (Determining the Solutions)
In some cases, you might go from setting goals to designing the plans that will get you to these goals; while in other cases, you will encounter problems on the way to your goals and have to design your way around them. So design will occur at both stages of the process, though it will occur much more often in figuring out how to get around problems. *In other words, most of the movement toward your goals comes from designing how to remove the root causes of your problems.* Problems are great because they are very specific impediments, so you know that you will move forward if you can identify and eliminate their root causes.

*Creating a design is like writing a movie script in that you visualize who will do what through time in order to achieve the goal.*

Visualize the goal or problem standing in your way, and then visualize practical solutions. When designing solutions, the objective is to change how you do things so that problems don’t recur—or recur so often. *Think about each problem individually and as the product of root causes—like the outcomes produced by a machine.* Then think about how the machine should be changed to produce good outcomes rather than bad ones. There are typically many paths toward achieving your goals, and you need to find only one of them that works, so it’s almost always doable.

But an effective design requires thinking things through and visualizing how things will come together and unfold over time.  *Then write down the plan so you don’t lose sight of it, and include who needs to do what and when.* The list of tasks falls out from this story (i.e., the plan), but they are not the same. The story, or plan, is what connects your goals to the tasks. For you to succeed, you must not lose sight of the goals or the story while focusing on the tasks; you must constantly refer back and forth.

When designing your plan, think about the timelines of various interconnected tasks. Sketch them out loosely and then refine them with the specific tasks. This is an iterative process, alternating between sketching out your broad steps (e.g., hire great people) and filling these in with more specific tasks with estimated timelines (e.g., in the next two weeks choose the headhunters to find the great people) that will have implications (e.g., costs, time, etc.). These will lead you to modify your design sketch until the design and tasks work well together. Being as specific as possible (e.g., specifying who will do what and when) allows you to visualize how the design will work at both a big-picture level and in detail. *It will also give you and others the to-do lists and target dates that will help direct you.*

Of course, not all plans will accomplish everything you want in the desired time frame. In such cases, it is essential that you look at what won’t be accomplished and ask yourself if the consequences are acceptable or unacceptable.

*It doesn’t take much time to design a good plan—literally just hours spread out over days or weeks*—and whatever amount of time you spend designing it will be only a small fraction of the time you spend executing it. But designing is very important because it determines what you will have to do to be effective. Most people make the very big mistake of spending virtually no time on this step because they are too preoccupied with execution. 

People successful with this stage have an ability to visualize and a practical understanding of how things really work. *Remember: Designing precedes doing! The design will give you your to-do list (i.e., the tasks).*

## 5) Doing the Tasks

Next, you and the others you need to rely on have to do the tasks that will get you to your goals. Great planners who don’t carry out their plans go nowhere. You need to “push through” to accomplish the goals. This requires the self-discipline to follow the script that is your design. I believe the importance of good work habits is vastly underrated. There are lots of books written about good work habits, so I won’t digress into what I believe is effective. *However, it is critical to know each day what you need to do and have the discipline to do it.* People with good work habits have to-do lists that are reasonably prioritized, and they make themselves do what needs to be done.

*You need to know whether you (and others) are following the plan, so you should establish clear benchmarks.* Ideally you should have someone other than yourself objectively measure if you (and others) are doing what you planned. If not, you need to diagnose why and resolve the problem.

People who are good at this stage can reliably execute a plan. They tend to be self-disciplined and proactive rather than reactive to the blizzard of daily tasks that can divert them from execution. They are results-oriented: they love to push themselves over the finish line to achieve the goal. If they see that daily tasks are taking them away from executing the plan (i.e., they identify this problem), they diagnose it and design how they can deal with both the daily tasks and moving forward with the plan.

## Designs and tasks have no purpose other than to achieve your goals. Said differently, goals are the sole purpose of designs and tasks. So you mustn’t forget how they’re related.

*Again, this 5-Step Process is iterative. This means that after completing one of the steps you will probably have acquired relevant information that leads you to modify the other steps.*

If this process is working, goals will change much more slowly than designs, which will change more slowly than tasks. Designs and tasks can be modified or changed often.

## Most importantly, ask yourself what is your biggest weakness that stands in the way of what you want.

For these two reasons, having people show you what you are missing can be painful, though it’s essential for your progress. *When you encounter that pain, try to remember that you can get what you want out of life if you can open-mindedly reflect, with the help of others, on what is standing in your way and then deal with it.*

People who don’t get what they want out of life fail at one or more of the five steps. *But being weak at any one of these steps is not a problem if you understand what you are weak at and successfully compensate for that weakness by seeking help.*

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-15%20at%2014.35.04.png)

## Values 1) Goals 2) Problems 3) Diagnoses 4) Designs 5) Tasks
Your values determine what you want, i.e., your goals. In trying to achieve your goals, you will encounter problems that have to be diagnosed. Only after determining the real root causes of these problems can you design a plan to get around them. Once you have a good plan, you have to muster the self-discipline to do what is required to make the plan succeed. Note that this process starts with your values, but it requires that you succeed at all five steps. While these steps require different abilities, you don’t have to be good at all of them. If you aren’t good at all of them (which is true for almost everyone), you need to know what you are bad at and how to compensate for your weaknesses. This requires you to put your ego aside, objectively reflect on your strengths and weaknesses, and seek the help from others.

*As you design and implement your plan to achieve your goals, you may find it helpful to consider that:*• Life is like a game where you seek to overcome the obstacles that stand in the way of achieving your goals. 
• You get better at this game through practice.• The game consists of a series of choices that have consequences.• You can’t stop the problems and choices from coming at you, so it’s better to learn how to deal with them. 
• You have the freedom to make whatever choices you want, though it’s best to be mindful of their consequences.
• The pain of problems is a call to find solutions rather than a reason for unhappiness and inaction, so it’s silly, pointless, and harmful to be upset at the problems and choices that come at you (though it’s understandable).• We all evolve at different paces, and it’s up to you to decide the pace at which you want to evolve.• The process goes better if you are as accurate as possible in all respects, including assessing your strengthsand weaknesses and adapting to them.

## Part 3 My Management Principles
While having a clearly conveyed great culture is important, that’s only half of the magic formula. The other half is having *great people*—i.e., people who have the values, abilities, and skills that fit the organization’s culture.

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-20%20at%2011.14.09.png)


### Every organization works like a machine to achieve its goals. This machine produces outcomes. By comparing the outcomes to the goals, those running the machine can see how well the machine is working.

This is the _feedback loop_ that those who are responsible for the machine need to run well in order to improve the machine. Based on the feedback, the machine can be adjusted to improve. The machine consists of two big parts—the culture and the people. If the outcomes are inconsistent with the goals, something must be wrong with the machine, which means that something must be wrong with the culture and/or the people. By diagnosing what is wrong, designing improvements, and implementing those improvements, the machine will evolve. In short, the evolutionary process is as follows. 

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-20%20at%2011.13.49.png)

The more frequently and effectively those in the machine go through this process, the more rapidly they and the machine will evolve. *An effective evolutionary process looks like this—i.e., lots of quality feedback loops produces a steep upward trajectory.*

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-20%20at%2011.15.20.png)

*An ineffective evolutionary process—i.e., one in which mistakes are infrequently looked at and weaknesses are not well identified*—looks like that shown below, i.e., fewer and/or less effective feedback loops produces a slower upward trajectory. In fact, if there are two few and/or bad quality feedback loops, there will be a decline because you won’t identify and deal with the problems that will kill you.

![](PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/PRINCIPLES%20BY%20RAY%20DALIO/Screen%20Shot%202017-03-20%20at%2011.16.28.png)

As you might have guessed from reading Part 2, I want Bridgewater to be a company in which people collectively: 
* work for what they want and not for what others want of them.* come up with the best independent opinions they can muster to move toward their goals.* stress-test their opinions by having the smartest people they can find to challenge them so they can find out where they are wrong.* are wary about overconfidence, and good at not knowing.* wrestle with reality, experiencing the results of their decisions and reflecting on what they did to produce them so that they can improve.

# The best advice I can give you is to ask yourself what do you want, then ask ‘what is true’—and then ask yourself ‘what should be done about it.’ I believe that if you do this you will move much faster toward what you want to get out of life than if you don’t!10) Do not feel bad about your mistakes or those of others. Love them!
12) Do not feel bad about your weaknesses or those of others.
22) Talk about “Is it true?” and “Does it make sense?”
26) Recognize that conflicts are essential for great relationships because they are the means by which people determine whether their principles are aligned and resolve their differences.
d) Leverage your communication.
a) Ask yourself whether you have earned the right to have an opinion.
c) If someone asks you a question, think first whether you’re the responsible party/right person to be answering the question.

39) First, match the person to the design.
a) Most importantly, find people who share your values.b) Look for people who are willing to look at themselves objectively and have character.c) Conceptual thinking and common sense are required in order to assign someone the responsibility for achieving goals (as distinct from tasks).

43) Choose those who understand the difference between goals and tasks to run things.

44) Recognize that People Are Built Very Differently
45) Think about their very different values, abilities, and skills
51) Remember that people who see things and think one way often have difficulty communicating and relating to people who see things and think another way.

52) Hire Right, Because the Penalties of Hiring Wrong Are Huge

63) Recognize that no matter how good you are at hiring, there is a high probability that the person you hire will not be the great person you need for the job.

67) Look down on your machine and yourself within it from the higher level.
69) Conduct the discussion at two levels when a problem occurs: 1) the “machine” level discussion of why themachine produced that outcome and 2) the “case at hand” discussion of what to do now about the problem.

71) Clearly assign responsibilities.
72) Hold people accountable and appreciate them holding you accountable.
74) Think like an owner, and expect the people you work with to do the same.

75) Force yourself and the people who work for you to do difficult things.
77) Know what you want and stick to it if you believe it’s right, even if others want to take you in another direction.
81) Avoid staying too distant.
84) Avoid the “theoretical should.”
88) Escalate when you can’t adequately handle your responsibilities, and make sure that the people who work for you do the same.

## 90) Probe Deep and Hard to Learn What to Expect from Your “Machine”
91) Know what your people are like, and make sure they do their jobs excellently.
92) Constantly probe the people who report to you, and encourage them to probe you.
96) Don’t “pick your battles.” Fight them all.
97) Don’t let people off the hook.
98) Don’t assume that people’s answers are correct

100) Evaluate People Accurately, Not “Kindly”
106) Provide constant, clear, and honest feedback, and encourage discussion of this feedback.
107) Understand that you and the people you manage will go through a process of personal evolution.
110) If someone is doing their job poorly, consider whether this is due to inadequate learning (i.e., training/experience) or inadequate ability.

117) Train and Test People Through Experiences
118) Understand that training is really guiding the process of personal evolution.
120) Provide constant feedback to put the learning in perspective.
121) Remember that everything is a case study.
123) Recognize that sometimes it is better to let people make mistakes so that they can learn from them rather than tell them the better decision.
## 124) Know what types of mistakes are acceptable and unacceptable, and don’t allow the people who work for you to make the unacceptable ones.
125) Recognize that behavior modification typically takes about 18 months of constant reinforcement.
129) When you find that someone is not a good “click” for a job, get them out of it ASAP.
# 132) Do not lower the bar.
136) Understand that problems are the fuel for improvement.
138) Don’t tolerate badness.
139) “Taste the soup.”
142) Don’t use the anonymous “we” and “they,” because that masks personal responsibility—use specific names.
143) Be very specific about problems; don’t start with generalizations.

148) Recognize that all problems are just manifestations of their root causes, so diagnose to understand what the problems are symptomatic of.
154) Keep in mind that diagnoses should produce outcomes.

166) Design Your Machine to Achieve Your Goals
## 167) Remember: You are designing a “machine” or system that will produce outcomes.
	a) A short-term goal probably won’t require you to build a machine.
	b) Beware of paying too much attention to what is coming at you and 	not enough attention to what your responsibilities are or how your machine should work to achieve your goals.

# 168) Don’t act before thinking. Take the time to come up with a game plan.
171) Recognize that design is an iterative process; between a bad “now” and a good “then” is a “working through it” period.
172) Visualize alternative machines and their outcomes, and then choose.

174) Most importantly, build the organization around goals rather than tasks.
a) First come up with the best workflow design, sketch it out in an organizational chart, visualize how the parts interact, specify what qualities are required for each job, and, only after that is done, choose the right people to fill the jobs.b) Organize departments and sub-departments around the most logical groupings.c) Make departments as self-sufficient as possible so that they have control over the resources they need to achieve the goals.d) The efficiency of an organization decreases and the bureaucracy of an organization increases in direct relation to the increase in the number of people and/or the complexity of the organization.

177) Constantly think about how to produce leverage.
a) You should be able to delegate the details away.
b) It is far better to find a few smart people and give them the best technology than to have a greaternumber of ordinary and less well-equipped people.
c) Use “leveragers.”

## 179) Don’t do work for people in another department or grab people from another department to do work for you unless you speak to the boss.
181) Assign responsibilities based on workflow design and people’s abilities, not job titles.
184) Tool: Use checklists.
186) Think clearly how things should go, and when they aren’t going that way, acknowledge it and investigate.

194) While everyone has the right to have questions and theories, only believable people have the right to have opinions.
190) Recognize the Power of Knowing How to Deal with Not Knowing
193) Remember that your goal is to find the best answer, not to give the best one you have.

196) Make All Decisions Logically, as Expected Value Calculations
b) Recognize opportunities where there isn’t much to lose and a lot to gain, even if the probability of the gain happening is low.
d) Don’t bet too much on anything. Make 15 or more good, uncorrelated bets.

198) Remember the 80/20 Rule, and Know What the Key 20% Is

199) Distinguish the important things from the unimportant things and deal with the important things first.

a) Don’t be a perfectionist.b) Since 80% of the juice can be gotten with the first 20% of the squeezing, there are relatively few (typically less than five) important things to consider in making a decision.c) Watch out for “detail anxiety.”d) Don’t mistake small things for unimportant things, because some small things can be very important.

201) Make sure all the “must-do’s” are above the bar before you do anything else.
209) Avoid the temptation to compromise on that which is uncompromisable.
210) Don’t try to please everyone.
