P.3 Strategic Inflection Point (SIP) is a time in the life of a business when its fundamental are about to change. That change can mean an opportunity to rise to new heights. It it may just as likely signal the beginning of the end. SIP can be caused by technological change but they are more than technological change. They can be caused by competitors but they are more than just competition. They are full-scale changes in the way business is conducted, so that simply adopting new technology or fighting the competition as you used to may be insufficient. 

P.15 Conference room 528, which is located twenty feet from my office, became the Intel war room. The oval table there is meant to seat about twelve people, but at several times each day more than thrity people were jammed in the room, sitting on the credenza, standing against the wall, coming and going, bringing missives from the front and leaving to execute agreed-upon courses of action. 

P.20 All businesses operate by some set of unstated rules and sometimes these rules change-often in very significant ways. Yet there is no flashing sing that heralds, these rule changes. They creep up on you as they crept up on us, without warning. You know only that something has changed, something big, something significant, even if it’s not entirely clear what that something is. What worked before doesn’t work anymore; you need to street the boat in a different direction quickly before you are in trouble, yet you have to get a feel of the new direction and the strength of the wind before you can hope to right the boat and set a new course. 

P.30 There are competitive forces and then there are super-competitive forces. I’ll call such a very large change in one of the six forces a “10X” change, suggesting that the force has become ten times what it was just recently. This is illustrated in the following diagram.
 

P.31 To manage a business in the face of a “10X” change is very, very difficult. The business responds differently to managerial actions that it did before. We have lost control and don’t know how to regain it. Eventually, a new equilibrium in the industry will be reached. Some businesses will be stronger, others will be weaker. However, the period of transition depicted in the diagram below is particularly confusing and treacherous. Now, nobody will ring a bell to call your attention to the fact that you are entering into such a transition. It’s a gradual process; the forces start to grow and, as they do, the characteristics of the business begin to change. Only the beginning and the end are clear; the transition in between is gradual and puzzling.

P.32 An SIP occurs where the old strategic picture dissolves and gives way to the new, allowing the business to ascend to new heights. However, if you don’t navigate your way through an inflection point, you got through a peak and after the peak the business declines. It is around such inflection points that managers puzzle and observe, “things are different, something has changed”. Put another way, a SIP is when the balance of forces shifts from the old structure, from the old ways of doing business and the old ways of competing, to the new. Before the SIP, the industry simply was more like the old. After it, it is more like the new. It is a point where the curve has subtly but profoundly changed, never change back again.

P.34 So how do we know that a set of circumstances is a strategic inflection point?
Most of the time, recognition takes place in stages. First, there is a troubling sense that something is different. Things don’t work the way they used to. Customers’ attitudes towards you are different. The development groups that have had a history of success no longer seem to be able to come up with the right product. Competitors that you wrote off or hardly knew existed are stealing business from you. The trade shows seem weird.
Then there is a growing dissonance between what your company thinks it is doing and what is actually happening inside the bowels of the organisation. Such misalignment between corporate statements and operational actions hints at more than the normal chaos that you have learned to live with. Eventually,  a new framework, a new set of understandings, a new set of acton emerges. It’s as if the group that was lost finds its bearings again. (This could take a year - or a decade) Last of all, a new set of corporate statements is generated, often by a new set of senior managers. 

P.46 Let’s think about what this transformation from the vertical industry structure to the horizontal must have been like at one of the mainframe computer companies. In particular, let’s look at it  from IBM’s standpoint. IBM had been the strongest player in the old industry. First of all, IBMs growth slowed down as such of computing went from mainframes to microprocessors-based personal computers. But that’s not all. IBM was composed of a group of people who had won time and time again, decade after decade, in the battle among vertical computer players. The mangers who ran IBM grew up in this world. They got selected for their excellence in developing products and competing in the marketplace within this framework. Their long reign of success deeply reinforced and ingrained the though processes and instincts that led to winning in the vertical industry. So when the industry changed, they attempted to use the same type of thinking regarding product development and competitiveness that had worked so well int he past. 

!!!P.50 In fact, there are two more lessons here. First, when a strategic inflection point sweeps through the industry, the more successful a participant was in the old industry structure, the more threatened it is by change and the more reluctant it is to adapt to it. Second, whereas the cost to enter a given industry in the face of well-entrenched participants can be very high, when the structure breaks, the costs to enter may become trivially small, giving rise to Compaq, Dells and Novells, each of which emerged from practically nothing to become major corporations. What’s common among these companies is that they all instinctively followed the rules for success in a horizontal industry. 

P.52 Simply put, it’s harder to be the best of class in several fields than in just one.

P.55 When a Wal-Mart moves into a small town, the environment changes for every retailer in that town. A “10X” factor has arrived. When the technology for sound in movies became popular, every silent actor and actress personally experienced the “10X” factor of technological change. When container shipping revolutionised sea transportation, a “10X” factor reordered the major ports around the world. Reading the daily newspaper through a “10X” lens constantly exposes potential strategic inflection point.

P.62 After each strategic inflection point, there are winners and there are losers. Whether a port (example with Seattle, Singapore) won or lost clearly depended on how it responded to the “10X” force in technology that engulfed it. 

P.64 In another example of denial, IBM’s management steadfastly blamed weakness in the worldwide economy as the cause of trouble at IBM in the late 1980s and early 1990s and continued to do that year after year as PCs progressively transformed the face of computing. But the last one the resistance to facing a painful new world was the most important. 

P68. Nothing signifies this more than the fact that Cray Computers Corporation, a company founded by the icon of the supercomputer age, Seymour Cray, was unable to maintain operations due to lack of funds. It’s yet another example illustrating that the person who is the star of a previous era is often the last one to adapt to change, the last one to yield to the logic of a strategy inflection point and tends to fall harder than most.

P.75 Much of the world is embroiled in what I want to call the “mother of all regulatory changes” privatisation. Companies that have had a long history of operating as state-woned monopolies, from China to the former Soviet Union to the United Kingdom, at the stroke of a pen are being placed in a competitive environment. They have no experience how to deal with competition. They never had to market to consumers; after all, why would a monopoly have to court customers?

P.76 Note that everywhere there are winners and losers. And note also that, to a large extent, whether a company became a winner or a loser was related to its degree of adaptability. Strategic inflection points offer promises as well as threats. It is at such times of fundamental change that the cliche “adapt or die” takes on its true meaning. 

P.83 We worked day and night to design the chip and in parallel, develop the manufacturing process. We worked as if our life depended on it, as in a way it did. From that project emerged the first functional 64-bit memory. As the first to product a working chip, we won the race. This was a big win for a startup! Next we poured our efforts into developing another chip, a 256-bit memory. Again, we worked day and night, and this was an even harder job. Thanks to a great deal of effort, we introduced our second product a short while after the first. 

P.87 We fought hard. We improved our quality and brought costs down but the Japanese producers fought back. Their principal weapon was the availability of high-quality product priced astonishingly low. In one instance, we got hold of a memo sent to the sales force of a large Japanese company. They key portion of the momo said, “Win with the 10% rule… Find AMD (another American company and Intel sockets… Quote 10% below their price… If they requote, go 10% AGAIN…      DON'T QUIT TILL YOU WIN!"

P.88 We had been losing money on memories for quite some time while trying to compete with the Japanese producers’ high-quality, low-priced, mass produced parts. But because business had b so good, we just kept at at it, looking for the magical answer been so good, we just kept at it, looking for the magical answer that would give us a premium price. We preserved because we could afford to. However, one business slowed down across the board and our other product couldn’t take up the slack, the losses really started to hurt. The need for a different memory strategy one that would stop the haemorrhage, was growing urgent.

P.89 Meanwhile, as the debates raged, we just went on losing more and more money. It was a grim and frustrating year. During that time we worked hard without a clear notion of how things were ever going to get better. We had lost our bearings. We were wandering in the VALLEY OF DEATH.

P.91 However, he convinced me to finish what his group had in the works. In other words, he convinced me to continue to do R&D for a product that he and I both knew we had no plans to sell. I support that even though our minds were made up about where we were going our emotions were still holding both of us back from full commitment to the new direction. I rationalised to myself that such as major change and to be accomplished in a number of smaller steps. But in a few months we came to the inevitable conclusion that this halfway decision was untenable and we finally worked up our determination and clearly decided not just in the management ranks but through out the whole organisation that we were getting out of the memory business, once and for all. I sure took you a long time. People who have no emotional stake in a decision can see what needs to be done sooner. I believe this has a great deal to do with why there is such a high turnover in the ranks of CEOs today. Every day, it seems, leaders who have been with the company for most of their working lives announce their departure, usually as the company is struggling through a period that has the looks of a strategic inflection point. More often than not, these CEOs are replaced by someone from outside. I suspect that the people coming in are probably not better managers or leaders than the people they are replacing. They have only one advantage, but it may be crucial: unlike the person who has devoted his entire life to the company and therefore has a history of deep involvement in the sequence of events that led to the present mess, the new mangers come unencumbered by such emotional involvement and therefore are capable of applying an impersonal logic to the situation. They can see things much more objectively than their predecessors did. 

P.93 If existing management want to keep their jobs when the basics of the business are undergoing profound change, they must adopt and outsider’s intellectual objectivity. They must do what they need to do to get through the strategic inflection point unfettered by any emotional attachment to the past. That’s what Gordon and I had to do when we figuratively went out the door, stomped out our cigarettes and returned to do the job!

P.98 One last lesson and this is a key one: while Intels business changed and management was looking for clever memory strategies and arguing among themselves, trying to figure out how to win an unwindable war, men and women lower in the organisation, unbeknownst to us, got us ready to execute the strategic turn that saved our necks and gave us a great future. By the time we made the decision to exit the memory business, only one out fo eight silicon fabrication plants was producing memories. The exit decision had less drastic consequences as a result of the actions of our middle managers. This is not unusual. People in the trenches are usually in touch with impending changes early. Salespeople understand shifting customer demands before management does; financial analysts are the earliest to know when the fundaments of a business change. While management was kept from responding by beliefs that were shaped by our earlier success, our production planners and financial analysts dealt with allocations and numbers in an objective world. For us senior managers, it took the crisis of an economic cycle and the sight of unrelenting red ink before we could summon up the gumption needed to execute a dramatic departure from our past. 

P.103 But a year from now, three years from now, five years from now, as we exhaust other means that are for now more cost-effective, the balance might shift and what we once correctly determined was noise might well emerge as a signal we had better pay heed to. These things are not cut and dried, and even if they were, things change. Therefore, you have to pay eternal attention to developments that could become a “10X” factor in your business. 

P.107 Ask these questions to attempt to distinguish signal from noise:

* Is your key competitor about to change? First, figure out who your key competitors is by asking a hypothetical question that I call the “silver bullet” test. It works like this: if you had just one bullet in a figurative pistol, whom among your many competitors would you save it for? Asked point-blank, this question usually provokes a visceral response and I find that people can normally give an answer without much hesitation. When the answer to this question stops being as crystal clear as it used to be and some of your people direct the silver bullet to competition s who didn’t merit this kind of attention previously, it’s time to sit up and pay special attention. When the importance of your competitors shifts, it is often a sign that something significant is going on.
* In an analogous fashion, you should ask, is your key competitor about to change? Does the company that in past years mattered the most to you and your business seem less important today? Does it look like another company is about to eclipse them? If so, it may be a sign of shifting industry dynamics. 
* Do people seem to be “losing it” around you? Does it seem that people who for years had been very competent have suddenly gotten decoupled from what really matters? Think about it. You and your management have both been selected by the evolutionary forces of your business to be at the top of your organisation. Your genes were right for the original business. But if key aspects of the business shift around you, the very process of genetic selection that got you and your associates where you are might retard your ability to recognise the new trends. A sign of this might be that all of a sudden some people “don’t seem to get it.” Conversely, it may be that you yourself are often inclined to shake your head in confusion. When they don’t get it or you don’t get it, it may not be because of encroaching age; it may be because the “it” has changed around you. 

P.108 Cassandra was the priestess who foretold the fall of Troy. Likewise, there are people who are quick to recognise impending change and cry out an early warning. Although they can come from anywhere in the company, Cassandra's are usually in middle management; often they work in the sales organization. They usually know more about upcoming change that the senior management because they spend so much time “outdoors” where the winds of the real world blow in their faces. IN other words, their genes have not been selected to achieve perfection in the old way. 

P.111 In the case of Intel’s exit form the memory business, how did Intel, the memory company, get to where only one factory out of eight was producing memory chips by the mid 1980s, making our exit from memories less cataclysmic? It got there by the autonomous actions of the finance and production planning people, who sat around painstakingly allocating wafer production capacity month by month, moving silicon wafers from product where they seemed wasteful memories were in the prime example of this. Peter Drucker quotes a definition of an entrepreneur as someone who moves resources from areas of lower productivity and yield to areas of higher productivity and yield. That’s what a properly motivated and intelligent middle manager will do with resources under his or her command. 

P.112 On the other hand, don’t shut off your radar screens and go on about your business, discounting everything even if at first it seems quite crummy. A danger in assessing the significance of changes lies in what I call the trap of the first version. 

P.113 Now, as you stare at your computer screen that’s connected to the Internet, waiting for a WWW page to slowly materialise, let your imagination flow a bit. What might this experience be like if transmission speed doubled? Or better yet, if it were improved by “10X”? But if your instincts suggest that a “10X” improvement could make this capability exciting or threatening, you may very well be looking at the beginning of what is going to be a strategic inflection point. Consequently, you must discipline yourself to think things through and separate the quality of the early versions from the longer-term potential and significance of a new product or technology. 

P.115 If you are in senior management, don’t feel you’re being a wimp of taking the time to solicit the views, convictions and passions of the experts. No statues will be carved for corporate leaders who charge off on the wrong side of a complex decision. Take your time until the news you hear starts to repeat what you’ve already heard, and until a conviction builds up in your own gut. If you are in middle management, don’t be a wimp. Don’t sit on the sidelines waiting for the senior people to make a decision so that later on you can criticise them over a beer “ My God, how could they be so dumb?” Your time for participating is now.

P.117 At the risk of sounding frivolous, you have to know when to hold your data and when to fold’em. You have to know when to argue with data. Yet you have to be able to argue with the data when your experience and judgment suggest the emergence of a force that may be too small to show up in the analysis but has the potential to grow so big as to change the rules your business operates by. The point is, when dealing with emerging trends, you may very well have to go against rational extrapolation of data and rely instead on anecdotal observations and your instincts. 

P.118 Simply put, fear can be the opposite of complacency. Complacency often afflicts precisely those who have been the most successful. It is often found in companies that have honed the sort of skills that are perfect for their environment. But when their environment changes, these companies my be the slowest to respond properly. A good dose of fear of losing may help sharpen their survival instincts. That’s why in a way I think that we at Intel were fortunate to have gone through the terrible times in 1985 and 1986 that I described in Chapter 5. Most of our managers still remember what it felt like to be on the losing side. Those memories make it easy to conjure up the lingering dread of a decline and generate the passion to stay out of it. It may sound strange but I’m convinced that the fear of repeating 1985 and 1986 has be an important ingredient in our success. 

P.127 This is a key point. The replacement of corporate heads is far more motivated by the need to bring in someone who is not invested in the past than to get somebody who is a better manager or a better leader in other ways. 

Senior managers got to where they are by having been good at what they do. And over time they have learned to lead with their strengths. So it’s not surprising that they will keep implementing the same strategic and tactical moves that worked for them during the course of their careers especially during their “championship season”. I call this phenomenon the inertia of success. It is extremely dangerous and it can reinforce denial. When the environment changes in such a way as to render the old skills and strengths less relevant, we almost instinctively cling to our past. We refuse to acknowledge changes around us, almost like a child who doesn’t like what he’s seeing so he closes his eyes and count to 100 and future that what bothered him will go away. We too close our eyes and are willing to work harder, to dedicate ourselves to our traditional tasks or skills, in the hope that they and hard work will get us there by the count of 100. The phrase you’re likely to hear at such times is “just give us a bit more time"

P.129 Strategic dissonance is so much an automatic reaction to a strategic inflection point that probing for it is perhaps the best test of one. When people in the company start asking questions like “But how can we say X when we do Y? more than anything else this is a trip -off that a strategic inflection point may very well be in the making. 

P.130 Resolution of strategic dissonance does not come in the form of a figurative light bulb going on. It some through experimentation. Loosen up the level of control that your organisation normally is accustomed to. Let people try different techniques, review different product, exploit different sales channels and go after different customers. Much as management has been devoted to making and keeping order in the company, at times like this they must become more tolerant of the new and the different. Only stepping out of the old ruts will bring new insights. 

P.132 Under the protection of this bubble you can make changes far more easily than when the vital signs of your business have all turned south. In other words, it is best when senior management recognises and accepts the inevitability of a strategic inflection point early on and acts before the vitality of the business has been sapped by the “10X” forces affecting it. The necessary transformation of the business will likely be a lot less wrenching and more successful if proper action is taken early and enforced decisively. 

P.133 When, during Intel’s memory crisis, I was in the manager’s shoes, for a long time I too was guilty of the same too-little-too-late syndrome. Ideally, the fear of a new environment sneaking up on us should keep us on our toes. Our sense of urgency should be aided by our judgment, instincts and observations that have been honed by dedicated spent in the business world. The fact is, because of our experience, very often we managers know that we need to do something. We even know what we should be doing. But we don’t trust our instincts or don’t act on them early enough to take advantage of the benign business bubble. We must discipline ourselves to overcome our tendency to do too little too late. 

P.135 Much as your business needs to experiment with new technologies and method of distribution, as a senior manager, you need to experiment with filling in the details of the new industry structure. Try out your evolving map on your close associates. You will need to discuss it in a friendly audience many times to clarify your own mindset. But there is another benefit too: These discussions will help get your organisation ready for change. 

P.140 To make it through the valley of death successfully, your first task is to form a mental image of what the company should look like when you get to the other side. This image not only needs to be clear enough for you to visualise but it also has to be crisp enough so you can communicate it simply to your tired, demoralised and confused stuff. You need to answer these questions in a single phrase that everybody can remember and, over time, can understand to mean exactly what you intended. In 1986, when we came up with the slogan “Intel, the microcomputer company,” that was exactly what we were trying to achieve. The phrase didn’t say anything what we were trying to semiconductors. 

P.143 Getting through strategic inflection points represents a fundamental transformation of your company from what you were to what you will be. The reason such a transformation is so hard is that all parts of the company were shaped by what you had been in the past. If you and your staff got your experience managing a computer company, how can you even imagine managing a software company? If you got your experience managing a broad-based semiconductor company, how can you even imagine what a microcomputer company might be like? Not surprisingly, the transformation implicit in surviving a strategic inflection point involves changing members of management one way or another. 

P.144 Be clear in this but be realistic also. Don’t compromise and don’t kid yourself. If you are describing a purpose that deep down you know you can’t achieve, you are dooming your chances of climbing out of the valley of death. 

P.146 A strategic transformation requires discipline and redeployment of all resources; without them, it turns out to be nothing more than an empty cliche. 

P.148 Resource shift dilemma, when is the right time? When the momentum of your existing strategy is still positive, your business is still growing, your customers and complementers still think highly of you ye there’s enough evidence of blips on your radar screen to warrant, at a minimum, exploring their significance. If your explorations confirms that they are real and are gaining, shift more resources on to them. 

P.151 First, it is very hard to lead an organisation out of the valley of death without a clear and simple strategic direction. After all, getting there sapped the energy of your organisation; it demoralised your employees and often set them agains one another. Demoralised organisation are unlikely to be able to deal with multiple objectives in their actions. It will be hard enough to lead them out with a single one. If competition is chasing you (and they always are this is why “only the paranoid survive”), you only get out of the valley of death by outrunning the people who are after you. And you can only outrun them if you commit yourself to a particular direction and go as fas as you can. You could argue that, since they are chasing you, you should give yourself all sorts of alternative directions in other words hedge. I say, “NO” Hedging is expensive and dilutes commitment. without exquisite focus, the resources and dilutes commitment. Without exquisite focus, the resources and energy of the organisation will be spread a mile wide and they will be  an inch deep. 

P.153 The point is this: how can you hope to mobilise a large team of employees to pull together, accept new and different job assignments, work in an uncertain environment and work hard despite the uncertainty of their future, if the leader of the company can’t or won’t articulate the shape of the other side of the valley? Clarity of direction, which includes describing what we are going after as well as describing what we will not be going after, is exceedingly important at the late stage of a strategic transformation. Much as in the middle of the strategic inflection process you needed to let chaos reign in order to explore your alternatives, to lead your organisation out of the resulting ambiguity and to energise your staff towards a new direction, you must rein in chaos. The time for listening to the Cassandra's is over. The time for experimentation is also over. The time to issue marching orders exquisitely clear marching order to the organisation is here. And the time to commit the resources of the corporation as well as our own resources your own time, visibility, speeches, statements in external forums (which are always gives more credibility inside the company than what you say directly to your employees) is upon you. Most of all, you must be a role model of the new strategy. That is the best way to prove that you are committed to it. 

P.155 When you have to reach large numbers of people, you can’t possibly over-communicate and over clarify. Give a lot of speeches to your employees, go to their workplaces, get them together and explain over and over what you’re trying to achieve (Take particular care to answer questions of the “Does it mean that…” variety. Those are the ones that offer the best chance of bringing your message home.) Your new thoughts and new arguments will take awhile to sink in. But you will find that repetition sharpens your articulation of the new direction and makes it increasingly clear to your employees. So speak and answer questions as often as possible; while it may seem like you’re repeating yourself, in reality you will be reinforcing a strategic message. 

P.157 Gordon Moore’s comment that half our staff would need to become software types in five years time was a very valid insight and one that has an equivalent in every company that’s struggling with a “10X” force. simply put, you can’t change a company without changing its management. I’m not saying they have to pack up their desks and be replaced. I’m saying that they themselves, every one of them, needs to change to be more in tune with the mandates of the new environment. They may need to go back to school, they may need a new assignment, they may need to spend some years in a foreign post. They need to adapt. If they can't or won’t, however, they will need to be replaced with other who are more in tune with the new world the company is heading to. 

P.160 The best results seem to prevail when bottom-up and top-down actions are equally strong. We can display this point in the following two-by-two matrix. The best quadrant to be in is the top right one strong top-down and strong bottom-up actions roughly balancing

P.162 What we needed was a balanced interaction between the middle managers, with their deep knowledge but narrow focus, and senior management, whose larger perspective could set a context. The dialectic between these two would often result in searing intellectual debates. But through such debates the shape of the other side of the valley would be become clear earlier, making a determined march in its direction more feasible. 

P.164 The other side of the valley of death represents a new industry order that was hard to visualise before the transition. Management did not have a mental map of the new landscape before they encountered it. Getting through the strategic inflection point required enduring a period of confusion, experimentation and chaos, followed by a period of single-minded determination to pursue a new direction toward an initially nebulous goal. It required listening to Cassandra's, deliberately fostering debates and constantly articulation the new direction, at first tentatively but more clearly with each repetition. It required casualties and personal transformation; it required accepting the fact that not all would survive and that those who did would no be the same as they had been before. 

P.182 I put my presentation together and finally give it to forty or so of our senior management team, some of whom know a whole lot more about my subject that I do and some of whom haven’t given any of it much thought. Comments on my presentation range from “This was the best strategic analysis you’ve ever done” to “why the hell did you waste so much time on the Internet?”. But I succeed with one thing: the centre of gravity of our management discussion shifts measurably.
