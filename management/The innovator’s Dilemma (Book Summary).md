From a video: [Disruptive Innovation Explained - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDrMAzCHFUU)
> Disruptive innovation transforms a product that is historically so expensive and complicated that only a few people with a lot of money and a lot skill could access it. Disruptive innovation makes it more affordable and accessible so that a much larger group of the population can have access to it.  

The “market creating strategy consists of following key actions: drive down costs, increase ease of use, and take the technology to non-consuming markets. - Michael E. Raynor (from The Innovator’s Manifesto)

Xii Sears was praised as one of the best-managed companies in the world at the very time it let Visa and MasterCard usurp the enormous lead it had established in the use of credit cards in retailing

Xii IBM dominated the mainframe market but missed by years the emergence of minicomputers, which were technologically much simpler than mainframes. 

Xii Many of these leading computer manufacturers were at one time regarded as among the best-managed companies in the world and were help up by journalists and scholars of management as example for all to follow. 

Xii Indeed, Digital was one of the most prominently features companies in the McKinsey study that led to the book In Search f Excellence. Yet a few years later, writers characterized DEC quite differently: Digital Equipment Corporation is a company in need of triage. Sales are drying up in its key minicomputer line. A two-year-old restructuring plan has failed miserably. … It has squandered two years trying halfway measures to respond to the low-margin personal computers and workstations that have transformed the computer industry.

XiV The list of leading companies that failed when confronted with disruptive changes in technology and market structure is long one. One theme common to all of these failures, however, is that the decisions that led to failure were made when the leaders in question were widely regarded as among the best companies in the world. 

XV Good management was the most powerful reason they failed to stay atop their industries. Precisely because these firms listened to their customers, invested aggressively in the new technologies that would provide their customers more and better products of the sort they wanted, and because they carefully studied market trends and systematically allocated investment capital to innovations that promised the best returns, they lost heir positions of leadership. 

XV What this implies at a deeper level is that many of what are now widely accepted principles of good management are, in fact, *only situationally appropriate.* There are times at which it is right not to listen to customers, right to invest in developing lower-performance products that promise lower margins, and right to aggressively pursue small, rather than substantial, markets. 

XV These rules I call /principles of disruptive innovation/, show that when good companies fail, it often has been because their managers either ignored these principles or chose to fight them. 

XVI /Technology/, as used in this book, means the processes by which an organization transforms labor, capital, materials, and information into products and services of greater value. 
/Innovation/ refers to a change in one of the technologies. 

XViii Most new technologies foster improved product performance. I call these /sustaining technologies/. An important finding revealed in this book is that rarely have even the most radically difficult sustaining technologies precipitated the failure of leading firms. 
However, /disruptive technologies/ emerge: innovations that results in *worse product performance* at least in the near-term. Ironically, in each of the instances studies in this book, it was disruptive technology that precipitated the leading firms’ failure.  Disruptive technologies bring to a market a very different value proposition that had been available previously.  Generally, disruptive technologies underperform established products in mainstream markets. But they have other features that a few fringe (and generally new) customers value. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller and, frequently, more convenient to use. 
Small off-road, Kawasaki, and Yamaha were disruptive technologies relative to the powerful, over-the-road cycle made by Harley-Davidson and BMW.

XiX The second element of the failure framework, the observation that technologies can progress faster than market demand, illustrated in Figure I.1

XX The las element of the failure framework, the conclusion by established companies that investing aggressively in disruptive technologies is not a rational financial decision for them to make, has three bases. First, disruptive products are simpler and cheaper, they generally promise lower margins, not greater profits. Second disruptive technologies typically are first commercialised in emerging or insignificant markets. And third, leading firms’ most profitable customers generally don#t want, and indeed initially can’t use products based on disruptive technogies. Hence, most companies with a practiced discipline of listening to their best customers and identifying new products that promise greater profitability and growth are rarely able to build a case for investing in disruptive technologies until it is too late. 

XXi Internal validity:  To establish the internal validity of the failure framework. If a framework or model cannot reliably explain what happened within a single industry, it cannot be applied to other situations with confidence. 

XXii Managers faced with disruptive technologies fail their companies when these forces overpower them.  The five laws or principles of disruptive technology are so strong that managers who ignore or fight with them are nearly powerless to pilot their companies through a disruptive technology storm. These chapter show, however, that if managers can understand and harness these forces, rather than fight them, they can in fact succeed spectacularly when confronted with disruptive technological change. 

### Principle #1: Companies depend on customers and investors for resources*
XXiii The only instances in which mainstream firms have successfully established a timely position in a disruptive technology were those in which the firms’ managers set up *an autonomous organisation* charged with building a *new and independent business* around the disruptive technology. 

### Principle #2: Small markets don’t solve the growth needs of large companies
XXiV But while a $40 million company needs to find just $8 million in revenues to grow at 20 percent in the subsequent year, a $4 billion company needs to find $800 million in new sales. No new markets are that large. As a consequence, the larger and more successful an organisation becomes, the weaker the argument that emerging markets can remain useful engines for growth. 
Those large established firms that have successfully seized strong positions in the new markets enabled by disruptive technologies have done so by giving responsibility to commercialise the disruptive technology to an organisation whose size matched the size of the targeted market. Small organisation can most easily respond to the opportunities for growth in a small market. 

### Principle #3: markets that don’t exist can’t be analyzed
XXVi It is in disruptive innovations, where we know least about the market, that there are such strong first-mover advantages. This is the innovator’s dilemma. Companies whose investment process demand quantification of market size and financial returns before they can enter a market get *paralysed or make serious mistakes* when faced with disruptive technologies. They demand market data when none exists and make judgments based upon financial projections when neither revenues or costs can, in fact, be known.  Using planning and marketing techniques that were developed to manage sustaining technologies in the very different context of disruptive ones is an exercise in flapping wings. 

Called *discovery-based planning*, it suggest that managers assume that forecasts are wrong, rather than right, and that the strategy they have choses to pursue may likewise be wrong. Investing and managing under such assumptions drives managers to develop plans for learning what needs to be known, a much more effective way to confront disruptive technologies successfully. 

### Principle #4: An organisation’s capabilities define its disabilities 
XXVii An organisation’s capabilities reside in two places. The first is in its processes-the methods by which people have learned to transform inputs of labor, energy, materials, information, cash and technology into outputs of higher value. The second is in the organisation’s values, which are the criteria that managers and employee in the organisation use when making prioritisation decisions. The ver processes and values that constitute and organisation’s capabilities in one context, define its disabilities in another context. 

### Principle #5: Technology supply may not equal market demand
XXViii _When the performance of two or more competing products has improved beyond what the market demands_, customers can no longer base their choice upon which is the higher performing product. The basis of product choice often evolves from functionality to reliability, then to convenience, and ultimately to price. 

XXX Good companies often begin their descent into failure by aggressively investing in the products and services that their most profitable customers want. 

XXXiV Good management taught in business schools: that you should always listen to and respond to the needs of your best customers, and that you should focus investments on those innovations that promise the highest return. But these two principles, in practice, actually sow the seeds of every successful company’s ultimate demise. That’s why we call it the innovators’s dilemma: *Doing the right things is the wrong thing.* This dilemma rears it head when a type of innovation that we’ve termed disruptive technology arises at the low end of the market, in the simplest, most unassuming applications. 

P4 Blindly following the maxim that good managers should keep close to their customers can sometimes be a fatal mistake

P10 Technologies of the first sort sustained the industry’s rate of improvement in product performance (total capacity and recording density were the two most common measures) and ranged in difficulty from incremental to radical. The industry’s dominant firms always led in developing and adopting these technologies. By contrast, innovations of the second sort disrupted or redefined performance trajectories - and consistently resulted in the failure of the industry’s leading firms.

P12 some of these were straightforward technology improvements; others were radical departures. But all had a similar impact on the industry: They helped manufacturers to sustain the rate of historical performance improvement that their customers had come to expect. 

P14 The established firms were the leading innovators not just in developing risky, complex, and expensive component technologies such as thin-film heads and disks, but in literally every other one of the sustaining innovations in the industry’s history. Even in relatively simple innovations, such as RLL recording codes (which took the industry from double-to-triple density disks), established firms were the successful pioneers, and entrants firms were the technology followers. Established firms beat out the entrants. 

P16 Generally *disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward*, consisting of *off-the-shelf components* put together in a *product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches*.  They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. *They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets* remote from and unimportant to, the mainstream. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2383.JPG)

P19 why were the leading drive makers unable to launch 8-inch drives until it was too late? Clearly, they were technologically capable of producing these drives. Their failure resulted from delay in making the strategic commitment to enter the emerging market in which the 8-inch drives initially could be sold. Interviews with marketing and engineering executives close to the companies suggest that the established 14-inch drive manufacturers were held captive by customers. 

P21 As in the 8-inch for 14-inch substitution, the first firms to produce 5.25-inch drives were entrants; on average, established firms lagged behind entrants by two years. By 1985, only half of the firms producing 8-inch drives had introduced 5.25-inch models. The other half never did. 

P22 Indeed, in early 1985, less than one year after Rodime introduced the first 3.5-inch drive and two years before conner Peripherals started shipping its product. Seagate personal showed working 3.5-inch prototype drives to customers for evaluation.  

Seagate’s marketers tested the 3.5-inch prototypes with customers in the desktop computing market it already served - manufacturers like IBM, and value added resellers of full-sized desktop computer systems. Not surprisingly, they indicated little interest in the smaller drive. They were looking for capacities of 40 and 60 megabytes for their next-generation machines, while the 3.5-inch architecture could provide only 20 MB-and at higher costs. 

In response to lukewarm reviews from customers, Seagate’s program manager lowered his 3.5-inch sales estimates, and the firm’s executives canceled the program. Their reasoning? The markets for 5.25-inch products were larger, and the sales generated by spending the engineering effort on new 5.25-inch product would create greater revenue for the company than would efforts targeted at new 3.5-inch products. 

P23 The fear of cannibalising sales of existing products is often cited as a reason why established firms delay the introduction of new technologies. 

P25 And, two years after the first 5.25-inch drive was introduced, 80 percent of the firms producing these disruptive drives were entrants. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2384.JPG)

*The first is that the disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward.* They generally packaged known technologies in a unique architecture and enabled the use of these products in applications were magnetic data storage and retrieval previously had not been technologically or economically feasible. 

P26 *The second pattern* is that the purpose of advanced technology development in the industry was always /to sustain/ established trajectories of performance improvement: to reach the *higher-performance, higher-margin domain* of the upper right of the trajectory map. Many of these technologies were radically new and difficult, but they were not disruptive. The customers of the leading disk drive suppliers led them toward these improvements. Sustaining technologies, as a result, did not precipitate failure. 

*The third pattern* shows that, despite the established firms’ technological prowess in leading sustaining innovations, from the simplest to the most radical, the firm that led the industry in every instance of *developing and adopting disruptive technologies were entrants to the industry*, not its incumbent leaders. 

In the context of the preceding analysis of the disk drive industry, this question can be sharpened considerably. The established firms were, in fact, aggressive, innovative and customer-sensitive in their approaches to *sustaining innovations* of every sort. But the problem established firms seem unable to confront successfully is that of /downward vision/ and mobility, in terms of the trajectory map.  *Finding new applications and markets for these new products seems to be a capability that each of these firms exhibited once, upon entry, and then apparently lost*. It was as if the *leading firms were held captive by their customers*, enabling attacking entrant firms to topple the incumbent industry leaders each time a disruptive technology emerged. Why this happened and is still happening is the subject of the next chapter. 

P34 Henderson and Clark, for example, conclude that companies’ organisational structures typically facilitate component-level innovations, because most product development organisations consists of subgroups that correspond to a product’s components. Such systems work very well as long as the product’s fundamental architecture does not require change. But say the authors, when architectural technology change is required, this type of structure impedes innovations that require people and groups to communicate and work together in a new ways. 
When Tom West, Data General’s project leader and a former long-time Digital employee, removed the cover of the DEC minicomputer and examined its structure, he saw “Digital’s organization chart in the design of the product”.

P34 In assessing blame for the failure of good companies, the distinction is sometimes made between *innovations requiring very different technological capabilities*, that is, so-called *radical change*, and those that *build upon well-practiced technological capabilities*, often called *incremental innovations.* 

P35 They found that firms failed when a technological change destroyed the value of competencies previously cultivated and succeeded when new technologies enhanced them. 

P36 Rather, if their customers needed an innovation, the leading firms somehow mustered the resources and wherewithal to develop and adopt it. Conversely, if their customer did not want or need an innovation, these firms found it impossible to commercialise even technologically simple innovations. 

P36 The concept of /the value network/ - the context within which a firm identifies and responds to customer’s needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for profit.  - is central to this synthesis. Within a value network, each firm’s competitive strategy, and particularly its past choices of markets, determines its *perceptions of the economic value of a new technology*. These perceptions, in turn, shape the rewards different firms expect to obtain through pursuit of sustaining and disruptive innovations. In established firms, *expected rewards*, in their turn, *drive the allocation of resources towards sustaining innovations and away from disruptive ones.* This pattern of resource allocation accounts for established firms’s consistent leadership in the former and their dismal performance in the latter. 

P37 While Figure 2.1 is drawn to describe the nested physical architecture of a product system, it also implies the existence of a nested network of producers and market through which the components at each level are made and sold to integrators at the next higher level in the system. Firms that design and assemble disk drives, for example, such as Quantum and Maxtor, procure read-write heads from firms specialising in  the manufacture of those heads, and they buy disks from other firms and spin motors, actuator motors, and integrated circuitry from still others. At the next higher level, firms that design and assemble computers may buy their integrated circuits, terminals, disk drives, IC packaging, and power supplies from various firm that manufacture those particular products. This nested commercial system is a value network. 

Figure 2.2 illustrates three value networks for computing applications. 
![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2387.JPG)

As firms gain experience within a given network, they are likely to develop capabilities, organisational structures, and cultures tailored to their value network’s distinctive requirements. Manufacturing volumes, the slope of ramps to volume production, product development cycle times, and organisational consensus identifying the customer and the customer’s needs may differ substantially from one value network to the next. 

P41 Conversely, portable and desktop computing customers were willing to pay a high price in 1988 for a cubic inch of size reduction, while customers in the other networks placed no value on that attribute at all. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2388.JPG)

P42 For example, competing within the mainframe network shown in Figure 2.2 entails a particular cost structure. Research, engineering, and development costs are substantial. Manufacturing overheads are high relative to direct cost because of low unit volumes and customised product configurations. Selling directly to end users involves significant sales force costs, and the field service network to support the complicated machines represents a substantial ongoing expense. All these costs must be incurred in order to provide the types of products and services customers in this value network require. For these reasons, makers of mainframe computers, and makers of the 14-inch disk drives sold to them historically needed gross profit margins of between 50 percent and 60 percent to cover the overhead costs structure inherent to the value network in which they competed. 

Competing in the portable computer value network, however, entails a very different cost structure. Most sales are made through national retail chains or by mail order. As a result, companies in this value network can be profitable with gross margins of 15 percent to 20 percent. Hence, just as a value network is characterised by a specific rank-ordering of product attributes valued by customers, it is also characterised by a specific cost structure required to provide the valued products and services. 

P42 Each value network’s  unique cost structure is illustrated in figure 2.4
![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2389.JPG)

Gross margins typically obtained by manufacturers of 14-inch disk drives, about 60 percent, are similar to those required by mainframe computer makers: 56 percent. Likewise, the margins 8-inch drive makers earned were similar to those earned by minicomputer companies (about 40 percent), and margins typical of the desktop value network, 25 percent, also typified both the computer makers and their disk drive suppliers. 

The cost structures characteristics of each value network can have a powerful effect on the sorts of innovations firms deem profitable. Essentially, innovations that are valued within a firm’s value network, or in a network where characteristic gross margins are higher, will be perceived as profitable. Those technologies whose attributes make them valuable only in networks with /lower/ gross margins, on the other hand will not be viewed as profitable, and are unlikely to attract resources or managerial interest. 

P44 The technology S-curve forms the centrepiece of thinking about technology strategy. It suggest that the magnitude of a products’s performance improvement in a given time period or due to a given amount of engineering effort is likely to differ as technologies mature. The theory posits that in the early stages of a technology, the rate of progress in performance will be relatively slow. As the technology becomes better understood, controlled and diffused, the rate of technological improvement will accelerate. But in tis mature stages, the technology will asymptotically approach a natural or physical limit such that ever greater periods of time or inputs of engineering effort will be required to achieve improvements. Figure 2.5 illustrates the resulting pattern. 

Hence, as depicted by the dotted curve in Figure 2.5, the challenge is to successfully switch technologies at the point where S-curves of old and new intersect. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2390.JPG)


P46 A disruptive innovation, however, cannot be plotted in a figure such as 2.5, because the vertical axis for a disruptive innovation, by definition, must measure /different/ attributes of performance than those relevant in established value networks. Because a disruptive technology get its commercial start in emerging value networks before invading established networks, an S-curve framework such as that and in Figure 2.6 is needed to describe it. *Disruptive technologies emerge and progress on their own, uniquely defined trajectories*, in a home value network. If and when they progress to the point that they can satisfy the level and nature of performance demanded in another value network, the disruptive technology can then invade it, knocking out the established technology and its established practitioners, /with stunning speed./

P46 Figures 2.5 and 2.6 illustrate clearly the innovator’s dilemma that precipitates the failure of leading firms. In disk drives (and in the other industries covered later in this book), prescriptions such as increased investments in R&D;  longer investment and planning horizons; technology scanning, forecasting and mapping; as well as research consortia and joint ventures are al relevant to the challenges posed by the sustaining innovations whose ideal pattern is depicted in Figure 2.5 Indeed, the evidence suggests that many of the best established firms have applied these remedies and that they can work when managed well in treating sustaining technologies. But none of these solutions addresses the situation in Figure 2.6, because it represents a threat of a fundamentally different nature. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2391.JPG)


P48 We saw in chapter 1, a  stunningly consistent pattern of successful implementation of sustaining innovations by established firms and their failure to deal with disruptive ones. The pattern was consistent because the managerial decisions that led to those outcomes made sense. Good managers do what makes sense, and what makes sense is primarily shaped by their value network. 

P48 My findings consistently showed that established firms confronted with disruptive technology change did not have trouble developing the requisite technology: Prototypes of the new drives had often been developed before management was asked to make a decision. Rather, disruptive projects stalled when it came to allocating scarce resources among competing product and technology development proposals (allocating resources between the two value networks shown at right and left in Figure 2.6)

P49 
* *Step #1 Disruptive technologies were first developed within established firms*
* *Step #2 Marketing personnel then sought reactions from their lead customers:* Not surprisingly, therefore, IBM showed no interest in Seagate’s disruptive 3.5-inch drives. IBM’s engineers and marketers were looking for 40 and 60 MB drives, and they already had a slot for 5.25-inch drives designed into their computer; they needed new drives that would take them further along their established performance trajectory. Finding little customer interest, Seagate’s marketers drew up pessimistic sales forecast. 

*ST412 (5.25-inch) a very successful product generating $300 million sales* annually in the desktop market that was near the end of its life cycle. Our forecasts for the *3.5-inch drive were under $50 million* because the laptop market was just emerging, and the 3.5-inch product just didn’t fit the bill. 

*Seagate managers made an explicit decision not to pursue the disruptive technology.* In other cases, managers did approve resources for pursuing a disruptive product - but, in the day-to-day decisions about how time and money would actually be allocated, engineers and marketers, acting in the best interest of the company, consciously and unconsciously starved the disruptive project of resources necessary for a timely launch. 

## DISRUPTIVE MARKET-GAP (vacuum for innovation)
Introduce this term to the broader mass, people on the internet write lot of about product-market fit, growth and all that bullshit. But no one writes about how to find ideas systematically *(practical principles to build disruptive startup)* , not like solving your own problems mantra. Find a disruptive market-gap and fill it with your innovation, then move on to before product-market fit (lean startup) and after product-market fit growth and scalability.

* *Step #3 Established firms set up the pace of sustaining technological development:* In response to the needs of current customers, the marketing managers threw impetus behind alternative sustaining projects, such as incorporating better heads or developing new recording codes. These gave customers what they wanted and could be targeted at large markets to generate the necessary sales and profits for maintaining growth. 

After Seagate executives shelved the 3.5-inch project, the firm began introducing new 5.25-inch models at a dramatically accelerated rate. 
In 1985, 1986, and 1987, the numbers of new models annually introduced as a percentage of the total number of its model on the market in the prior year were 57, 78, and 115 percent, respectively. 

Clearly, the motivation in doing this was to win the *competitive wars against other established firms*, which were making similar improvements, *rather than to prepare for an attack by entrants from below.* 

## BEFORE PRODUCT/MARKET-FIT (build-measure-learn feedback loop)
* *Step #4 New companies were formed, and markets for the disruptive technologies were found by TRIAL AND ERROR (Lean Startup / MVP Customer Development, Design Sprint):* new companies, usually including frustrated engineers from established firms, were formed to exploit the disruptive product architecture. 

The start-ups, however, were as unsuccessful as their former employers in attracting established computer makers to the disruptive architecture. Consequently, they had to find /new customers/. The applications that emerged in this very uncertain, probing process were the minicomputer, the desktop personal computer, and the laptop computer.  In retrospect, these were obvious markets for hard drives, but at the time, their ultimate *size and significance were highly uncertain.* 

*The founders of these firms sold their product without a clear marketing strategy-essentially selling to whoever would buy. Out of what was largely a trial-and-error approach to the market, the ultimately dominant applications for their product emerged.*  _(Pivot)_

## AFTER PRODUCT/MARKET-FIT (Scale/Grow)
* *Step #5 The entrants moved upmarket:* Once the start-ups had discovered an operating base in new markets, they realised that, by adopting sustaining improvements in new components technologies, they could increase the capacity of their drives at a faster rate than their new market requires. They blazed trajectories of 50 percent annual improvement, fixing their sights on the large, established computer markets immediately above them on the performance scale. The established firms’ views downmarket and the entrants firm’s views upmarket were asymmetrical. In contrast to the unattractive margins and market size that established firms saw when eyeing the new, emerging marketing for simpler drives, the entrants saw the potential volumes and margins in the upscale, high-performance markets above them as highly attractive. 

Thus, Seagate, which started in the desktop personal computer market, subsequently invaded and came to dominate the minicomputer, engineering workstations, and mainframe computer markets for disk drives. Seagate, in turn, was driven from the desktop personal computer market for disk drives by Conner and Quantum, the pioneering manufacturers of 3.5-inch drives. 

* *Step #6: Established firms belatedly jumped on the bandwagon to defend their customer base:* When the smaller models began to invade established market segments, the drive makers that had initially controlled those markets took their prototypes off the shelf (where they had been put in Step 3) and introduced them in order to defend their customer base in their own market. By this, of course, the new architecture had shed its disruptive character and become fully performance-competitive with larger drives in the established markets. Also through some established manufacturers were able to defend their market positions through *belated introduction of new architecture*, many found that the entrant firms had developed /insurmountable advantages in manufacturing cost and design experience/, and they eventually withdrew from the market. The firms attacking from value networks below brought with them cost structures set to achieve *profitability at lower gross margins*. The *attackers therefore were able to price their products profitability*, while the defending established firms experienced a severe *price wars*. 

ControlData, the 14-inch leader, never captured even a 1 percent share of the minicomputer market. It introduced its 8-inch drive nearly three years after the pioneering start-ups did, and nearly all of its drives were sold to its existing mainframe customers. Miniscribe, Quantum, and Micropolis all had the same *cannibalistic experience when they belatedly introduced disruptive technology drives*. They failed to capture a significant share of the new market, and at best succeeded in defending a portion of heir prior business. The popular slogan “stay close to your customers” appears not always to be robust advice. One instead might expect customers to lead their suppliers toward sustaining innovations and to provide no leadership-or even to explicitly mislead-in instances of disruptive technology change. 

P54 Flash memory is a disruptive technology. Flash chips consume less than 5 percent of the power that a disk drive of equivalent capacity would consume, and because they have no moving parts, they are far more rugged than disk memory. 

P55 Clark’s concept of technological hierarchies (see note 4) focuses on the skills and technological understanding that a company accumulates as the result of the product and process technology problems it has addressed in the past. 

P56 On the surface, lash memory involves radically different electronics technology than the core competence of disk drive makers (magnetics and mechanics). But such firm as Quantum, Seagate, and Western Digital have developed deep expertise in custom integrated circuit design through embedding increasingly intelligent control circuitry and cash memory in their drives.

The flash card business is /very similar/. In other words, flash memory actually /builds upon/ important competencies that many drive makers have developed. 

P57 Seagate entered the flash market in 1993 via its purchase of a 25 percent equity stake in SunDisk Corporation. Seagate and SunDisk together designed the chips and cards; the chips were fabricated by Matsushita, and the cards were assembled by a Korean manufacturer, Anam. Seagate itself marketed the cards. Quantum entered with a different partner, Silicon Storage Technology, which designed the chips that were then fabricated and assembled by contract. 

P57 Flash technology is what Henderson and Clark would call radical technology. Its product architecture and fundamental technological concept are novel compared to disk drives. The organisational structure viewpoint would predict that, unless they created organisationally independent groups to design flash products, established firms would stumble badly. Seagate and Quantum did, indeed, rely on /independent groups/ and did develop competitive products. 

P57 The technology S-curve is often used to predict whether an emerging technology is likely to supplant an established one. The operative trigger is the slope of the curve of the established technology. If the curve has passed its point of inflection, so that its second derivative is negative (the technology is improving at a decreasing rate), then a new technology may emerge to supplant the established one. Figure 2.7 shows that the S-curve for magnetic disk recording /still has not hit its point of inflection/: Not only is the areal density improving, as of 1995, it was improving at an increasing rate. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2392.JPG)

The S-curve framework would lead us to predict, therefore, that whether or not established disk drive companies posses the capability to design flash cards, flash memory will not pose a threat to them until the magnetic memory S-curve has passed its point of inflection and the rate of improvement in density begins to decline.



P58 The value network framework asserts that none of the foregoing frameworks (S-Curve Framework) is a sufficient predictor of success. Specifically, even where established firms did not posses the requisite technological skills to develop a new technology, they would marshal the resources to develop or acquire them if their customers demanded it. Furthermore, the value network suggest that technology S-curves are useful predictors only with sustaining technologies. Disruptive technologies generally improve at a parallel pace with established ones-their trajectories do not intersect. *The S-curve framework, therefore, asks the wrong question* when it is used to assess disruptive technology. What matters instead is whether the disruptive technology is improving from below along a trajectory that will ultimately intersect with what the /market needs/. 

The value network framework would assert that even through firms such as Seagate and Quantum are able technologically to develop competitive flash memory products, where they invest the resources and managerial energy to build strong market position in the technology will depend on whether *flash memory can be initially valued and deployed within the value networks in which the firms make their money.* As of 1996, flash memory can only be used in value networks different from those of the typical disk drive maker. This illustrated in Figure 2.8.

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2393.JPG)

P60 And the price of the flash capacity required to meet what the low end of the portable computing market demands (about 350MB in 1995) is too high: The cost of that much flash capacity would be fifty times higher than comparable disk storage.

P60 Hence, because flash cards are being used in markets completely different from those Quantum and Seagate typically engage - palmtop computers, electronic clipboards, cash registers, electronic cameras, and so on- the value network framework would predict that firms similar to Quantum and Seagate are not likely to build market-leading positions in flash memory. This is not because  the technology is too difficult or their organisational structures impede effective development, but because their *resources will become absorbed in fighting for and defending larger chunks of business in the mainstream disk drive* value networks in which they currently make their money. 

Indeed, the marketing director for a leading flash card producer observed, “We’re finding that as hard disk drive manufacturers move up to the gigabyte range, they are unable to be *cost competitive at the lower capacities.* As a result, *disk drive makers are pulling out of markets in the 10 to 40 megabyte range and creating a vacuum into which flash can move.* 

P61 SunDisk (renamed SanDisk), however, a strategy which, as we shall see, is an effective way to address disruptive technology. 

## Implications of the value network framework for innovation
P61
1. *The context, or value network,* in which a firm competes has a profound influence on its ability to marshal and focus the necessary resources and capabilities to overcome the technological and organisational hurdles that impede innovation. The boundaries of a value network are determined by a unique definition of *product performance*. Value networks are also defined by particular *cost structures* inherent in addressing customers needs within the network. 
2. A *key determinant of the probability* of an innovative effort’s *commercial success* is the degree to which it addresses the well-understood needs of known actors within the value network. *Incumbent firms are likely to lead* their industries in innovations of all sorts-architecture and components-*that address needs within their value network*, regardless of intrinsic technological character or difficulty. These are straightforward innovations; their value and application are clear. Conversely, *incumbent firms are likely to lag in the development of technologies*-even those in which the technology involved is intrinsically simple-*that only address customer’s needs in emerging value networks.* *Disruptive innovations* are complex because t*heir value and application are uncertain*, according to the criteria used by incumbent firms. 
3. Established firms decisions to ignore technologies that do not address their customer needs become fatal when two distinct trajectories interact. The first defines the performance demanded over time within a given value network, and the second traces the performance that technologists are able to provide within a gives technological paradigm. The trajectory of performance improvement that technology is able to provide may have a distinctly different slope from the trajectory of performance improvement demanded in the system-of-use by downstream customers within any given value network. But when the slopes differ, new technologies that are initially performance-competitive only within emerging or commercially remote value networks my migrate into other networks *(speed of improvement of technology)*, providing vehicle for innovators in new networks to attack established ones. When such an attack occurs, it is because technological progress has diminished the relevance of differences in the rank-ordering of performance attributes across different value networks. For example, the disk drive attributes of size and weight were far more important in the desktop computing value network than they were in the mainframe and minicomputer value networks. When technological progress in 5.25-inch drives enabled manufacturers to satisfy the attribute prioritization in the mainframe and minicomputer networks, which prized total capacity and high speed, as well as that in the desktop network, the *boundaries between the value networks ceased to be barriers to entry for 5.25-inch drive makers.* 
4. *Entrant firms have an attacker’s advantage over established firms* in those innovations-generally new product architectures involves little new technology per se-that disrupt or redefine the level, rate, and direction of progress in an established technological trajectory.  This is so because such technologies generate no value within the established networks. The only way established firms can lead in commercialising such technologies is to *enter the value network in which they create value*.  As Richard Tedlow noted in this history of retaining in America (in which supermarkets and discount retailing play the role of disruptive technologies), /“ the most formidable barrier the established firms faced is that they did not want to do this.”/
5. In the instances, although this /“attackers’ advantage”/ is associated with a disruptive technology change, the essence of the of the attacker’s advantage is in the ease with which entrants, relative to incumbents, can identify and make strategic commitments to attack and develop emerging market applications, or value networks. At its core, therefore, the issue may be the relative *flexibility of successful established firms versus entrants firms to change strategic and costs structures*, not technologies.  /(Lean Startup)/ These propositions provide new dimensions for analysing technological innovation. In additional to the required capabilities inherent in new technologies and in the innovating organisation, firms faced with disruptive technologies must examine the /implications of innovation for their relevant value networks/. *The key considerations are whether the performance attributes implicit in the innovation will be valued within the networks already served by the innovator; whether other networks must be addressed or new ones created in order to realise value for the innovations;* and whether market and technological trajectories may eventually intersect, carrying technologies that do not address customers needs today to squarely address their needs in the future. 

# Chapter 3
P69 Over its history, leading firms have successfully adopted a series of sustaining innovations, both incremental and radical, in components and architecture, but almost the entire population of mechanical shovel manufacturers was wiped out by a disruptive technology-hydraulics-that the leaders’ customers and their economic structure had caused them initially to ignore. *The triumph of hydraulic excavators took twenty years.* 

P71 Despite the radical nature of the technological change, however, gasoline technology had a sustaining impact on the mechanical excavator industry.  *Twenty-three of the twenty-five largest makers of team shovels successfully negotiated the transition to gasoline power.*

P72 Only four of the thirty or so established manufacturers of cable-acuted equipment in business in the 1950s had successfully transformed themselves into sustainable hydraulic excavator manufacturers by the 1970s. Most of others failed. The firms that overran the excavation equipment industry at this point were all entrants into the hydraulics generation: John Deere etc. 

P74 Limited by the power and strength of available hydraulic pumps seals, the capacity of these early machines was a mere 1/4 cubic yard, as graphed in Figure 3.3. Their reach was also limited to about six feet. Whereas the best cable excavators could rotate a full 360 degrees on their track base, the most flexible backhoes could rotate only 180 degrees. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2396.JPG)


Because their capacity was so small and their reach so short, *hydraulic excavators were of no use to mining, general excavation, or sewer contractors,* who were demanding machines with buckets that held 1 to 4 cubic yards. *As a result, the entrant firms had to develop a new application for their products.* They began to sell their excavators as attachments for the black of small industrial and farm tractors made by Ford, John Deere.

P75 Hydraulic backhoes attached to highly mobile tractors could do these jobs in less than an hour per house, and the became extremely popular with contractors building large tract subdivisions during the housing booms that followed WW2 and the Korean war. 

P75 The early users of hydraulic excavators were, in a word, very different from the mainstream customers of the cable shovel manufacturers-in size, in needs, and in the distribution channels through which they bough. They constituted a new value network for mechanical excavation. Interestingly, just as the performance of smaller architecture disk drives was measured in different metrics than the performance of large drives (weight, ruggedness, and power consumption versus capacity and speed.) The performance of the first backhoes was measured differently from the performance of cable-actuated equipment. The metrics features most prominently in the early product literature of hydraulic backhoes were shovel width (contractors wanted to dig narrow, shallow tranches) and the speed and manoeuvrability of the tractor. 

P76 The maximum available bucket size had reached 3/8 cubic yard by 1955, 1/2 cubic yard by 1960, and 2 cubic yards by 1965. By 1974, the largest hydraulic excavators had the muscle to lift 10 cubic yards. This trajectory of improvement, which was far more rapid than the rate of improvement demanded in any of the excavator markets, carried this disruptive hydraulics technology upward from its original market through the large, mainstream excavation markets. 

P77 Just as Seagate Technology was one of the first firms to develop prototype 3.5-inch drives, Bucyrus Erie, the leading cable shovel maker, was keenly aware of the emergence of hydraulic excavating technology. By 1950 (about two years after the first backhoe appeared) Bucyrus purchased a fledgling hydraulic backhoe company the Milwaukee Hydraulic Corporation. Bucyrus faced precisely the same problem in marketing its hydraulic backhoe as Seagate had faced with its 3.5-inch drives: *Its most powerful mainstream customers had no use for it.* 

P77 Bucyrus Erie’s response was a new product, introduced in 1951, called “Hydrohoe”. Instead of using three hydraulic cylinders, it used only two, one to curl the shovel into the earth and one to “crowd” or draw the shovel toward the cab; it used a cable mechanism to lift the shovel. *The Hydrohoe was thus a hybrid of the two technologies, reminiscent of the early transoceanic steamships outfitted with sails.* There is no evidence, however, that the Hydrohoe’s hybrid design resulted from Bucyrus engineers being “stuck” in some sort of cable-based engineering parading. Rather the cable lift mechanism was the only viable way at that time, based o the state of hydraulics technology, to give the Hydrohoe the bucket capacity and reach that Bucyrus marketers through they needed to appeal to their existing customers needs. 

P78 *Rather than commercialise the disruptive technology in the value network in which the current attributes of hydraulics were prized. Bucyrus tried to adapt the technology to fit its own value network.* Despite this attempt, the Hydrohoe was still too limited in capacity and reach and did not sell well to Bucyrus customers. Bucyrus kept its Hydrohoe on the market for over a decade, attempting periodically to upgrade in performance to make it acceptable to its customers, but the machine was never commercially successful. *Ultimately the company returned to the cable shovels that its customer needed.* 

P79 This is typical of industries facing a disruptive technology: The leading firms in the established technology remain *financially strong until the disruptive technology is, in fact, in the mids of their mainstream market.* 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2397.JPG)

P80 In general, the successful entrants accepted the capabilities of hydraulics technology in the 1940s and 1950s as a given and cultivated new market application in which the technology, as it existed, could create value. And as a general rule, the established firms saw the situation the other way around: They took the markets needs as the given. *They consequently sought to adapt or improve the technology in ways that would allow them to market the new technology to their existing customers as a sustaining improvement.* 

## P80 Consistently, established firms attempt to push the technology into their established markets, while the successful entrants find a new market that values the technology. 

P81 By the early 1970s, all of these firms had been driven from the were, piping, and general excavation markets by the entrants, most of which had refined their technological capabilities initially in the small-contractor market. 

P81 But once both cable-and hydraulics-acuted systems could satidfy mainstream market requirements, excavation contractors could no longer base their choce of equipment on which had longer reach and greater bucket capacity. Both were good enough, and the fact that cable was better ceased to have competitive relevance. Contractors found, however, that hydraulic machines were much less prone to breakdowns than cable-actuated excavators. In particular, those who had experience the life-threatening snap of a cable while hefting a heavy bucket embraced reliable hydraulics quickly, as soon as it was capable of doing the job. Once both technologies were good enough in the basic capabilities demanded, therefore, the basis of product choice in the market shifted to reliability.

P83 So, as we have seen before. *These companies did not fail because the technology wasn’t available.* They did not fail because they lacked information about hydraulics or how to use it; indeed, the best of them used it as soon as it could help their customers. They did not fail because management was sleepy or arrogant. *The failed because hydraulics didn’t make sense-until it was too late.*  

## P83 Working harder, being smarter, investing more aggressively, and listening more astutely to customers are all solutions to the problems posed by new sustaining technologies. But these paradigms of sound management are useless-even counterproductive, in many instances-when dealing with disruptive technology.

# Chapter 4
P89 There is considerable upward /mobility/ into other networks. It is in restraining /downward mobility/ into the markets enabled by disruptive technologies that the value networks exercise such unusual power. 

P89 Rational managers, as we shall see, can rarely build a cogent case for entering small, poorly defined lo-end markets that offer only lower profitability.  in good companies, resources and energy coalesce most readily behind proposals *to attack upmarket into higher-performance products* that can earn higher margins. 

P91 Indeed, disruptive technologies have such as devastating impact because the firms that first commercialised each generation of disruptive disk drives chose not to remain contained within their initial value network. Rather, they reached as far upmarket as they could in each new product generation, until their drives packed the capacity to appeal to the value networks above them. *It is this /upward mobility/ that makes disruptive technologies so dangerous to established firms-and so /attractive to entrants./* 

P91 Value network is a particular cost structure that firms within it must create if they are to provide the product and services in the priority their customers demand. Thus, as the disk drive makers became large and successful within their “home” value network, they developed a very specific economic character: tuning their levels of effort and expenses in research, development, sales and marketing and administration to the needs of their customers and the challenges of their competitors. Gross margins tended to evolve in each value network to levels that enabled the better disk drive makers to make money, given these costs of doing business. 

P92 In turn, this gave these companies a very specific model for improving profitability. *Generally, they found it difficult to improve profitability by hacking out cots while steadfastly standing in their mainstream market.* The research, development, marketing, and administrative costs they were incurring were all critical to remaining competitive in their mainstream business. Moving upmarket toward higher-performance products that promised higher gross margins was usually a more straightforward path to profit improvement. *Moving downmarket was anathema to that objective.* 

P92 The obviousness of the path toward profit improvement is shown in Figure 4.2. The three bars on the left depict the size of the desktop, minicomputer, and mainframe computer value networks in 1981 and are labelled with the characteristics margins enjoyed by disk drive makers in each of those networks. Gross margins are clearly higher in higher-end markets, compensating manufacturers for the higher level of overhead characteristic of those business. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2398.JPG)

P92 The differences in the size of these markets and the characteristic coct structures across these value networks created serious asymmetries in the combat among these firms. Firms making 8-inch drives for the minicomputer market, for example, had cost structures requiring gross margins of 40 percent. Aggressively moving downmarket would have pitted them agains foes who had honed their cost structures to make money at 25 percent gross margins. On the other hand, *moving upmarket* enabled them to take a relatively lower-cost structure into a market that was accustomed to *giving its supplies 60 percent gross margins.*

### P92 Which  direction made sense? 
A similar asymmetry faced the makers of 5.25-inch drives in 1986, as they decided whether to spend their resources building a position in the emerging market for 3.5-inch dries in portable computers or to move up toward the minicomputer and mainframe companies. 

P93 Committing development resources to launch higher-performance products that could garner higher gross margins generally both offered greater returns and caused less pain. As their managers were making repeated decisions about which new product development proposals they should fund and which they should shelve, *proposal to develop higher-performance products targeted at the larger, higher-margin markets immediately above them always got the resources.*

## In other words, sensible resource allocation processes were at the root of companies upward mobility and downmarket immobility across the boundaries of the value networks in the disk drive industry.  
P94 Other scholars have found evidence in other industries that as companies leave their disruptive roots in search of *greater profitability* in the market tiers above them, they gradually come to *acquire the cost structures* required to compete in those upper market tiers. This exacerbates their problem of downward mobility. 

P94 The first model describes *resource allocation* as a rational, top-down decision-making process in which senior managers weight alternative proposals for investment in innovation and put money into those projects that they find to be consistent with firms strategy and to offer the *highest return on investment.* *Proposals that don’t clear these hurdles are killed.* 

P95 In most organisation, managers careers receive a big boost when they play a key sponsorship role in very successful projects-and their careers can be permanently derailed if they have the bad judgment or is fortune to back project that fail. Middle managers aren’t penalized of all failures, of course. Projects that fail because the technologists couldn’t deliver, for example, often are not (necessarily) regarded as failures at all, because a lot os learned form the effort and because technology development is generally regarded as an unpredictable, probabilistic endeavour. But project that fail because the market wasn’t there have far more serious implications for managers careers. These tend to be much more expensive and public failures. They generally occur after the company has made full investment in product design, manufacturing, engineering, marketing, and distribution. hence, middle managers-acting in both their own and the company’s interest-tend to back those projects for which market demand seems most assured. They then work to package the proposals for their chosen projects in ways geared to win senior management approval. As such, *while senior managers many think they’re making the resource allocation decision, many of the really critical resource allocation decisions have actually been made long before senior management gets involved.* Middle managers have made their decisions about which project they’ll back and carry to senior management-and which they will allow to languish. 

/P96 First project towards higher performance and current value network (mainframe, minicomputers), the other one towards new value network and emerging market (fax, printers) smaller, cheaper, disruptive disk drive./

*P97 Which of the two projects will the two levels-up manager back? In the tug-of-war of development resources, projects targeted at the explicit needs of current customers or at the needs of existing users that a supplier has not yet been able to reach will always win over proposals to develop products for markets that do not exist.*

P97 This is because, in fact, the best resource allocation systems are designed precisely to weed out ideas that are unlikely to find large, profitable, receptive markets. *Any company that doesn’t have a systematic way of targeting its development resources towards customers needs, in fact, will fail*

P97 The most //vexing managerial aspect of this problem of asymmetry, where the easiest path to growth and profit is up, and the most deadly /attacks come from below/, is that *“good” management-working harder and smarter and being more visionary-doesn’t solve the problem*

P98 Since the new disruptive technology makes no sense for their current value network. It is *very difficult for a manger to motivate* competent people to energetically and persistently pursue a course of action that *they think MAKES NO SENSE.*

P98 In August 1994, I was visiting the CEO of one of the largest disk drive companies and asked him what his firm was doing about the 1.8-inch drive. This clearly touched a hot button. He pointed to a shelf in his office where *a sample 1.8-inch drive was perched.* “You see that?” he demanded. “That’s the fourth generation of 1.8-inch drives we’ve developed-each one with more capacity than the last. *But we haven’t sold any. We want to be ready when the market is there*, but here just isn’t a market for them yet. 

P99 The CEO had decided that the company was going to catch this next disruptive wave early and had shepherded the project through to a successful, economical design. *But among the employees, there aw nothing about a $80 million, low-end market that solved the growth and profit problems of a multibillion dollar company*-especially when capable competitors were doing all they could to steal ways the customers providing those billions. 

P100 Hence, it is not just the customers of an established firm that hold it captive to their needs. *Established firms are also captive to the /financial/ structure and organisational culture inherent in the value network* in which they compete- a captivity that can block any rational for timely investment tin the next wave of disruptive technology. 

P100 The impetus to drift upmarket can be particularly powerful when a firm’s *customers themselves are migration upmarket.* In such circumstances, suppliers of an intermediate component such as a disk drive may not sense their northeasterly migration because they are embedded among competitors and customers experiencing a similar drift. 

P100 In this light, we can see how easy it would have been for the leading 8-inch disk drive makers-Priam, Quantum, and Shugart-to miss the 5.25-inch generation of drives. *Not a single one of their core customers, for example, Digital Equipment, Prime Computer, Data General, Want Laboratories, and Nixdorf, successfully introduced a desktop computer.* Instead, each was moving upmarket itself toward ever higher performance segments of their markets, trying to win the business of customers who historically had used mainframes. Similarly, not a single one of the customers of the 14-inch drive makers-mainframe makers such as Univac, Burroughts, NCR, ICL, Siemens, and Amdahl-ever made a bold enough move downmarket into minicomputers to become a significant player there. 

## P100 Three factors
1. the promise of upmarket margins, 
2. the simultaneous upmarket movement of many of a company’s customers, 
3. and the difficult of cutting costs to move downmarket profitability
together create powerful barriers to /downward mobility./

P101 *an important strategic implication of this rational pattern of upmarket movement is that it can create vacuum in low-end value networks that draws in entrants with technologies and cost structures better suited to competitions.* One of these powerful downmarket voids occurred in the steel industry, for example, when entrant companies employing disruptive minimill process technology entered through low-end beachheads; they have attacked relentlessly upmarket ever since. 

P102 In 1995, it cost about $400 million to build a cost-competitive steel minimill and about $6 billion to build a cost-competitive integrated mill. In terms of capital cost per ton of steel making capacity, integrated mills are more than four times as costly to build.  As a result, minimills share of the North American market has grown from nothing in 1965 to 19 percent in 1975, 32 percent in 1985, and 40 percent tin 1995. Experts predict they will account for half of all steel production by the run of the century.. Minimills virtually dominate the North American market for rods, bars, and structural beams. Yet not a single one of the world’s major integrated steel companies to date has built a mill employing minimill technology. Why would none of them do something that makes so much sense? The explanation forwarded most recently by the business press, especially the United Staes, is that the managers of the integrated companies are conservative, backward-looking, risk-averse, and incompetent. Consider these indictments.

> Last year, U.S. Steel Corp. closed fifteen of its facilities, claiming they had become “noncompetitive.” Three years ago, Bethlehem Steel Corp. shuttered major portions of its plants in Johnstown PA, and Lackawanna, NY… The closing of these major steel complexes is the final dramatic concession from today’s chief executives that management has not been doing its job. It represents decades of maximising profits to look good for the short term.   

P103 *Minimill steelmaking is a disruptive technology.* When it emerged in the 1960s, because it used scrap steel, it produced steel of marginal quality. The properties of its product varied according to the metallurgical composition and impurities of the scrap. Hence, about the only market that minimill products could address was that for steel reinforcing bars (rebars)- *right at the bottom of the market in terms of quality, cost, and margins.* This market was the least attractive of those served by established steel makers. And not only were margins low, but customers were the least loyal: They would switch suppliers at will, dealing with whoever offered the lowest price. The integrated steel makers were almost relieved to be rid of the rebar business. 

## P103 The minimills, however, saw the rebar market quite differently. They had very different cost structures than those of the integrated mills, little depreciation and no research and development costs, low sales expenses, (mostly telephone bills), and minimal general managerial overhead. They could sell by telephone virtually all the steel they could make-and sell it profitably. 

P104 As the trajectory map in Figure 4.2 indicates, the minimills next attacked the markets for larger bars, rods, and angle irons immediately above them. *By 1980, they had captured 90 percent of the rebar market and held about 30 percent of the markets for bars, rods, and angle irons. At the time of the minimills attack the bar, rod and angle iron shapes brought the lowest margins in the integrated mills products lines (because of the costs of integrated mills, described above, so they couldn’t be profitable in the low end markets because of the value network).* As a consequence, the integrated steel makers were, again, almost relieved to be rid of the business, and by the midd 1980s this market belonged to the minimills. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2399.JPG)

Once their position in the market for bars, rods, and angle irons seemed secure, the minimills continued their march upmarket, this time toward structural beams. 

P105 Targeting the premium end of the market pleased the integrated mills investors: For example, Bethlehem Steel market value had leapt from $175 million in 1986 to $2.4 billon in 1989. This represented a very attractive return on the $1.3 billion the company invested in R&D and plant and equipment during this period. The business press generously  acknowledged these aggressive, well-placed investments.

> Bethlehem’s CEO has worked wonders. Over the past three years he mounted a highly personal campaign to improve the quality and productivity of Bethlehem’s basic steel business.    

P107 Most important, a cost-competitive continuous thin-slab casting and rolling mill could be built for less than $250 million-one-tenth the capita cost of a traditional sheet mill and a relativity manageable investment for a minimill steel maker. As the outset, thin-slab casting technology could not offer the smooth, defect-free surface finish required by the integrated mills mainstream customers (makers of cans, cars, and appliances). The only markets were those such as construction decking and corrugated steel for culverts, pipes and Quonset huts, in which users were more sensitive to price than to surface blemishes. *Thin-slab casting was a disruptive technology.* 
Furthermore, large, capable, and hungry integrated competitors were busy trying to rob each other’s most profitable business with the large auto, appliance, and can companies. It made no sense for them to target capital investment at thin-slab casting, positioned as it was in the least-profitable, most price-competitive and commodity-like end of their business. Indeed, after seriously considering between 1987 and 1988 whether to invest in thin-slab casting at an amount then projects to be about $150 million, both Bethlehem and USX elected instead to invest in conventional thick-slab continuous casters at a cost of $250 million to protect and enhance the profitability of the business with their mainstream customers. 
*Not surprisingly, Nucor saw the situation another way. Unencumbered by the demand of profitable customers in the sheet steel business and benefiting from a cost structure forged at the bottom of the industry,* Nucor fired up the world’s first continuous thin-slab casting facility in Crawfordsille, Indiana, in 1989, and constructed a second mill in Hickman, Arkansas, in 1998. It increased its capacity at both sites by 80 percent in 1995. 

P108 Analysts estimate that Nucor had captured 7 percent of the massive North American sheet market by 1996-hardly enough to concern the integrated mills, because Nucors success has been limited to the commoditised, least-profitable end of their product line. Of course, in its effort to win higher-margin business with higher-quality products from these mills, Nucor has already improved the surface quality of its sheet steel substantially. 

## P108 thus, the integrated steel companies’ march to the profitable northeast corner of the steel industry is a story of aggressive investment, rational decision making, close attention to the needs of mainstream customers, and record profits. It is the same innovator’s dilemma that confounded the leading providers of disk drives and mechanical excavators: Sound managerial decisions are at the very root of their impeding fall from industry leadership. 

# Part Two - Managing Disruptive Technological Change
P112 Again, this is not to say that good and bad management aren’t key factors affecting the fortunes of firms. But as a general explanation, the *managers of the companies studies here had a great track record* in understanding customers future needs, identifying which technologies could best address those needs, and in investing to develop and implement them. It was only when confronted with disruptive technology that they failed. There had, therefore, to be a reason why *good managers consistently made wrong decisions when faced with disruptive technological change.*

P112 The reason is that /good management/  itself was the root cause. Managers played the game they way it was supposed to be played. The very *decision-making and resource-allocation process* that are key to the success of established companies are the very processes *that reject disruptive technologies*: listening carefully to customers; tracking competitors across carefully; and investing resources to design and build higher performance, higher-quality products тчат шилл зиелд греатер профит that will yield greater profit. These are the reasons why great firms stumbled or failed when confronted with disruptive technological change. Successful companies want their resources to be focused on activities that address customers need, that promise higher profits, that are technologically feasible, and that help them play in substantial markets. Yet, to expect the process that accomplish these things also to do something like *nurturing disruptive technologies-to focus resources on proposals that customers reject, that offer lower profit, that underperform existing technologies and can only be sound in insignificant markets*-is akin to flapping one’s arm with wings strapped to them in an attempt to fly.  Such expectations involve fighting some fundamental tendencies about the way successful organisations work and about how their performance is evaluated. 

P113 Those executives who succeeded tended to manage by a very different set of rules than those that failed. There were, in fact, five fundamental principles of organisational nature that *managers in the successful firms consistently recognised and harnessed.* The firms that lost their battles with disruptive technologies chose to ignore or fight them.  These principles are:
1. Resource dependence: Customers effectively control the pattern of resource allocation in well-run companies. 
2. Small markets don’t solve the growth needs of large companies.
3. The ultimate uses or application for disruptive technologies are unknowable in advance. Failure is an intrinsic step towards success.
4. Organisations have capabilities that exist independently of the capabilities of the people who work within them. Organisations capabilities reside in their processes and their values-and the very processes and values that constitute their core capabilities within the current business model also define their disabilities when confronted with disruption. 
5. Technology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones that constitute their greatest value in emerging markets. 

## P113 How did the successful managers harness these principles to their advantage? (Lean Startup)
1. They embedded projects to develop and commercialise disruptive technologies within an organisation whose customers needed them. When managers aligned a disruptive innovation with the “right” customers, customer demand increased the probability that the innovation would get the resources it needed. 
2. They placed project to develop disruptive technologies in organisations small enough to get excited about small opportunities and small wins. 
3. They planned to fail early and inexpensively in the search for the market for a disruptive technology. They found that their markets generally coalesced through an iterative process of trial, learning and trial again. 
4. They utilised some of the resources of the mainstream organisation to address the disruption, but they were careful no to leverage its processes and values. They created different ways of working within an organisation whose values and cost structure were turned to the disruptive task at hand. 
5. *When commercialising disruptive technologies, they “found or developed new markets” that valued the attributes of the disruptive products, rather than search for a technological breakthrough so that the disruptive product could compete as a sustaining technology in mainstream markets.* 

# Chapter 5
P117 It is a company’s customers who effectively control what it can and cannot do. As we have seen in the disk drive industry, companies were willing to bet enormous amounts on technologically risky projects when it was clear that their customers needed the resulting products. But they are unable to muster the wherewithal to execute much simpler disruptive projects if existing profitable customers didn’t need the products. 

P118 Even if a manager has a bold vision to take her or his company in a very different direction, the *power of the customer-focused people* and processes in any company well-adapted to survival in its competitive environment *will rejects the manager’s attempts* to change direction. It is forces outside the organisation, rather than the managers within it, that dictate the company’s course. 

P118 What, then should managers do when faced with a disruptive technology that the company’s customers explicitly do not want? One option is to *convince everyone in the firm that the company* should pursue it anyway, that it has long-term strategic importance despite rejection by the customers who pay the bills and despite lower profitability than the upmarket alternatives. The other option would be *to create an independent organisation and embed it among emerging customers* that do need the technology. Which works best?

P118 Managers who choose the first option essentially are picking a fight with a powerful tendency of organisation nature-that customers, not managers, essentially control the investment patterns of a company. By contrast, *managers who choose the second options align themselves with this tendency, harnessing rather that fighting its power.* The cases presented in this chapter provide strong evidence that the second options offers far higher probabilities of success than the first one. 

P118 The mechanism through which customers control the investment of a firm is the resource allocation process-the process that determines which initiatives get staff and money and which don’t. Good resource allocation processes are designed to weed out proposals that customers don’t want. when these decision-making processes work well, *if customers don’t want a product, it won’t get funded;* if they do want it, it will. This is how things must work in great companies. They must invest in things customers want-and the better they become at doing this, the more successful they will be. 

P120 From the point of view of the relative importance of specific decisions, those of executives properly call for first attention. But from the point of view of aggregate importance, *it is not decisions of executives, but of non-executive participants in organisations which should enlist major interest.*  So how do non-executive participants make their resource allocation decisions? They decide which projects they will propose to senior management and which they will give priority to, based upon their understanding of what types of customers and product are most profitable to the company. 

P120 Individuals career trajectories can soar when they sponsor highly profitable innovation programs. It is possible to break out of this system of customer control, however. They spun out independent companies to commercialise the disruptive technology. 

P121 As the 5.25-inch pioneers began to invade the minicomputer market from below, for all the reasons already described, Quantum’s sales began to sag. In 1984 several Quantum’s employees saw a potential market for a thin 3.5-inch drive plugged into an expansion slot in IBM XT- and AT-class desktop computers-drives that would be sold to personal computers users rather than the OEM minicomputer manufacturers that had accounted for all of Quantum’s revenues. They determined to leave Quantum and start a new firm to commercialise their idea. Rather than let them leave unencumbered, however, Quantum#s executives *financed and retained 80 percent ownership* of shit spinoff venture, called Plus Development Corporation, and set the *company up in different facilities.* It was a completely self-sufficient organisation, with its *own executive staff* and all of the functional capabilities required in *an independent company. Plus was extremely successful.*

## P121 Quantum then purchased the remaining 20 percent of Plus, essentially closed down the old corporation, and installed Plus’s executives in Quantum#s most senior positions. 
P122 *They reconfigures Plus’s 3.5-inch products to appeal to OEM desktop computer makers, such as Apple*, just as the capacity vector for 3.5-inch drives was *invading the desktop market,* as shown in the disk drive trajectory map in Figure 1.7. Quantum, thus reconstituted as a 3.5-inch drive maker, has aggressively adopted sustaining component technology innovations, *moving upmarket toward engineering workstations,* and has also successfully negotiated the sustaining architectural innovation in2.5-inch dries. *By 1994 the new Quantum had become the largest unit-volume producer of disk drives in the world.*

P123 Engineers and marketers at the company’s principal Minneapolis facility kept getting pulled off the 8-inch program to resolve problems in the launch of next-generation 14-inch products for CDS’s mainstream customers. CDC launched its first 5.25-inch model two years after Seagate’s pioneering product appeared in 1980. This time, however, CDC located its 5.25-inch effort in Oklahoma City. This was done, according to one manger, “*not to escape CDC’s Minneapolis engineering culture, but to isolate the (5.25-inch product) group from the company’s mainstream customers.*

P123 Micropolis Corp., an early disk drive leader founded in 1978 to make 8-inch drives, was the only other industry player to succcessfully make the transitions to a disrptuve platform. I did not use the spin—out strategy thtat had worked for Quantum and Control Data, however, choosing instead to manage the change from within the mainstream company. 

P123 Micropolis began to change in 1982, when founder and CEO Stuart mabon intuitively perceived the trajectories of market demand and technology supply mapped in Figure 1.7 and decided that the firm should become primarily a maker of 5.25inch drives. While initially hoping to keep adequate resources focused on developing its next generation of 8-inch drives so that Micropolis could staddle both markets, he assigned the company’s premier engineers to the 5.25-inch program. Mabon recalls that it took “*100 percent of my time and energy for eighteen month*” to keep adequate resources focused on the 5.25-inch program, because the organisation’s own mechanisms allocated resources to where the customers were-8-inch drives. By 1984, Micropolis had failed to keep pace with competition in the minicomputer market for disk drives and withdrew its remaining 8-inch models. With Herculean effort, however, it did succeed in its 5.25-inch programs. Figure 5.1 shows why this struggle occurred: In making the transition, Micropolis assumed a position on a very different technological trajectory. It had to walk away from every one of its major customers and *replace the lost revenues with sales of the new product line* to an entirely different group of desktop computer makers Mabon remembers the *experience as the most exhausting of his life.*

P124 The struggles recounted earlier of Seagate Technology’s attempts to sell 3.5-inch drives and of Bucyrus Erie’s failed attempt to sell its early Hydrohoe only to its mainstream customers illustrate how the theory of *resource dependence* can be applied to cases of disruptive technologies. In both instances, Seagate and Bucyrus were among the first in their industries to develop these disruptive products. But despite senior managers’ decisions to introduce them, the impetus or organisational energy required to launch the products aggressively into *the appropriate value networks simply did no coalesce*-until customers needed them. 

P125 In the introduction, exploring the image of how *people learned to fly, I noted that all attempts had ended in failure as long as they consisted of fighting fundamental laws of nature.* Bernoulli’s principle, and the notions of lift, drag and resistance began to be understood, and flying machines were designed that accounted for or harnessed those laws, people flew quite successfully. By analogy, this is what Quantum and Control Data did. *By embedding independent organisations within an entirely different value network, where they were dependent upon the appropriate set of customers for survival, those managers harnessed the powerful forces of resource dependence.* The CEO of Micropolis fought them, but he won a rare costly victory.

P126 A similar sequence of events characterised the mergence of the portable computer, where the market was created and dominated by a set of entrants like Toshiba, Sharp, and Zenith. Apple and IBM, the leading desktop makers, *did not introduce portable models until the portables performance trajectory intersected with the computing needs of their customers.*

P126 DEC didn’t stumble for lack of trying of course. Four times between 1983 and 1995 it introduces lines of personal computers targeted at consumers, products that were technologically much simpler than DEC’s minicomputers. But four times it failed to build business in this value network that were perceived within the company as profitable. *Fours times it withdrew from the personal computer market.* *Why? DEC launched all four forays from within the mainstream company.*

P127 In trying to enter the desktop personal computing business form within it mainstream orgnaizaiton, DEC was forces to staddle the two different cost structures intrinsic to to different value networks. It simply *couldn’t hack away enough overhead cost to be competitive in low-end personal computers* because it needed those costs to remain competitive in its higher-performance products. 

P127 How did IBM do it? It created an *autonomous organisation in Florida, far away from its New York state headquarters*, that was free to produce components from any source, to sell through its own channels, and to forge a cost structure appropriate to the technological and competitive requirements of the personal computing market. 

 P127 It seems to be very difficult to manage the peaceful, unambiguous coexistence of two cost structures, and two models for how to make money, within a single company. 

## P128 The conclusion that a single organisation might simply be incapable of competently pursuing disruptive technology, while remaining competitive in mainstream markets, bothers some “can-do” managers-and, in fact, most managers try to do exactly what Micropolies and DEC did: maintain their competitive intensity in the mainstream, while simultaneously trying to pursue disruptive technology. The evidence is strong that such efforts rarely succeed; position in one market will suffer unless to separate organisations, embedded within the appropriate value networks, pursue their separate customers. 

P128 The technology of discount retailing was disruptive to traditional operations because the quality of service and selection offered by discounters played /havoc/ with the accustomed metrics of quality retailing. Moreover, the cost structure required to compete profitably in discount retailing was fundamental different than that which department stores had developed to compete within their value networks. 

P128 The first discount store was Korvette’s. They focused on products that “sold themselves” because customers already knew how to use them. Relying on national brand image to establish the value and quality of their products, these discounters eliminated the needs for knowledgeable salespeople; they also focused on the *group of customers least attractive to mainstream retailers*: “young wives of blue collar workers with young children”. This was counter to the upscale formulas department stores historically had used to define quality retailing and to improve profits. *Discounters didn’t accept lower profits* than those of traditional retailers, however; they just earned their *profits through a different formula.* 
* Low gross margins and high inventory turns. Table 5.1 summaries the three positions. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2402.JPG)

Just like the minimills, discounters took advantage of their cost structure to move upmarket and seize share from competing traditional retailers at a stunning rate: first at the low end, in brand-name hard goods such as hardware, small appliances, and luggage, and later in territory further to the northeast such as home furnishing and clothing. Figure 5.2 illustrates how stunning the discounters invasion was.

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2403.JPG)

P130 Kresge (with its Kmart chain) and Dayton Hudson (with the Target chain) succeeded. *They both created focused discount retailing organisations that were independent from their traditional business.* *They recognised and harnessed the forces of resource dependence.*

## P131 In making its commitment to discount retailing, Kresge decided to exit the variety store business entirely: In 1959 it hired a new CEO, Harry Cunningham, whose sole mission was to convert Kresge into a discounting powerhouse. Cunningham, in turn, brought in an entirely new management team, so that by 1971 there “was not a single operating vice presented, regional manager, assistant regional manager, or regional merchandise manager who was not new on the job. 
P131 Woolworth, on the other hand, attempted to support a program of sustaining improvements in technology, capacity, and facilities in its core variety store business while simultaneously investing in disruptive discounting. *Unfortunately (but predictably), Woolworth proved unable to sustain within a single organisation the two different cultures*, and two different models of how to make a profit, that were required to be successful in variety and discount retailing. 

P132 Not surprisingly, Woolworth’s venture into discount retailing failed: it closed its last Woolco store in 1982. Woolworht’s organisation strategy for succeeding in disruptive discount retailing was the same as Digital Equipment’s strategy for launching its personal computer business. Both founded new ventures within the mainstream organisation that had to earn money by mainstream rules, and neither could achieve the cost structure and profit model required to succeed in the mainstream value network.

P133 HP’s experience in the personal computer printer business illustrates how a company’s pursuit of a disruptive technology by spinning out an independent organisation might entail, in the end, killing another of its business units. 

P134 Although it was never framed as such in the debates of the time, in-jet printing was a disruptive technology. It was slower than the laser jet, its resolution was worse, and its cost per printed page was higher. But the printer itself was smaller and potentially much less expensive than the laser jet. At these lower pries, it promised lower gross margin dollars per unit than the laser jet. *Thus, the ink-jet printer was a classic disruptive product, relative to the laser jet business.* /(how to identify if a product is disruptive or not)/

P134 HP created a completely autonomous organisational unit, located in Vancouver, Washington, with responsibility for making the in-jet printer a success. It hen let the two businesses compete against each other. Each has behaved classically. As shown in Figure 5.4, the laser jet division has moved sharply upmarket, in a strategy reminiscent of 14-inch drives, mainframe computers, and integrated steel mills. The ink-jet printer isn't as good the laser jet and many never be. But the critical question is whether the ink jet could ever be as good a printer as the personal desktop computing market demands. The answer appears to be yes. The resolution and speed of ink-jet printers, while still inferior to those of laser jets, are now clearly good enough for many students, professions, and other un-networked users of desktop computers. HP's ink-jet printer business is now capturing many of those who would formerly have been laser jet users.

P135 And by staying int he laser business, as well, HP has joined IBM’s mainframe business and the integrated steel companies in making a /lot of money/ while executing an upmarket-retreat. 

# Chapter 6
P139 Managers who confront disruptive technological change must be leaders, not followers, in commercialising disruptive technology.  
* Leadership is more crucial in coping with disruptive technologies than with sustaining ones, 
* and that small, emerging markets cannot solve the near-term growth and profit requirements of large companies. 

P139 The evidence form the disk drive industry shows that *creating new markets is significantly less risky and more rewarding than entering established markets* again entrenched competition. But as companies become larger and more successful, it becomes even more difficult to enter emerging market early enough. *Because growing companies need to add increasingly large chunk of new revenue each year just to maintain their desire rate of growth,* it becomes less and less possible that small markets can be viable as vehicle through which to find these chunks of revenue. 

## P141 As with most disagreements in management theory, neither position is always right. Indeed, some findings from the study of the disk drive industry give some insights into when leadership is critical and when followership makes better sense. 

P140 Thin-film heads technology. Yet, it turned out, where a firm led or followed in this innovation did not make a substantial difference in its competitive position. 

P142 Each of the other sustaining technologies in the industry’ history present a similar picture. There is no evidence that any of the leaders in developing and adopting sustaining technologies developed a discernible competitive advantage over the followers. 

P143 In contrast to the evidence that leadership in sustaining technologies has historically conferred little advantage on the pioneering disk drive firms, there is strong evidence that leadership in disruptive technology has been very important. 

## The companies that entered the new value networks enabled by disruptive generations of disk drives within the first two years after those drives appeared were six times more likely to succeed that those that entered later. 

P146 The numbers beneath the matrix show that only three of the fifty-one firms (6 percent) that entered established markets ever reached the $100 million revenue benchmark. In contrast, 37 percent of the firms that led in disruptive technological innovation-those entering markets that were less than two years old-surpassed the $100 million level, as shown on the right side of Table 6.1. Whether a firm was a start-up or a diversified firm had little impact on its success rate. What mattered appears not to have been its organisational form, but whether it was a leader in introducing disruptive products and creating the market in which they were sold. 

P146 The firms that led in launching disruptive products together logged a cumulative total of $62 billion dollars in revenues between 1976 and 1994. Those that followed into the markets later, after those markets had become established, logged only 3.3 billion in total revenue. It is indeed, an innovator’s dilemma. *Firms that sought growth by entering small, emerging markets logged twenty times the revenues of the firms pursuing growth in large markets.* The difference in revenues per firm is even more striking. The firms that followed late into the markets enabled by disruptive technology, on the left half of the matrix, generated an average cumulative total of 64,5 million per firm. The average company that led in disruptive technology generated $1.9 billion in revenues. 

P147 Good managers are driven to keep their organisations growing for many reasons. One is that growth rates have a strong effect on share prices (if company’s current share price is predicated on a consensus growth forecast of 20 percent, and the market’s consensus for growth is subsequently revised downward to 15 percent growth, then the company’s share price will likely fall-even though its revenues and earnings will still be growing at a healthy rate. 

P148 Disruptive technologies facilitate the emergence of new markets, and there are no $800 million emerging markets. But it is precisely when emerging markets are small-when they are least attractive to large companies in search for big chunks of new revenueThat entry into them is so critical. How can a manger of a large, successful company deal with these realities of size and growth when confronted by disruptive change?
1. Try to affect the growth rate of the emerging market, so that it becomes big enough, fast enough, to make a meaningful den on the trajectory of profit and revenue growth of a large company. 
2. Wait until the market has emerged and become better defined, and then enter after it “has become large enough to be interesting.”
3. Place responsibility to commercialise disruptive technologies in organisations small enough that their performance will be meaningfully affected by the revenues, profits, and small orders flowing from the disruptive business in its earliest years.

P150 Apple sold 140,000 Newtons in 1993 and 1994, its first two years on the market. Most observers, of course, viewed the Newton as a big flop.  But was the newton a failure? The timing of Newton’s entry into the handheld market was akin to the timing of the Apple II into the desktop market. It was a market-creating, disruptive product targeted at an undefinable set of users whose needs were unknown to either themselves or Apple. On that basis, Newton’s sales should have been a pleasant surprise to Apple’s executives: It outsold the Apple II in its first two years by a factor of more than three to one. *But while selling 43,000 units was viewed as an IPO-qualifying triumph in the smaller Apple of 1979, selling 140,000 Newtons was viewed as a failure in the giant Apple of 1994.* 

P151 Disruptive technologies often enable something to be done that previously had been deemed impossible. Because of this, when they initially emerge, neither manufacturers nor customers know how or why the products will be used, and hence do not know what specific features of the product will be and will not ultimately be valued. Building such markets entails a process of mutual discovery by customers and manufacturers-and this simply takes time. 

P151 *Because emerging markets are small by definition, the organisations competing in them must be able to become profitable at small scale.* This is crucial because organisations or project that are perceived as being profitable and successful can continue to attract financial and human resources both from their corporate parents and from capital markets. Initiatives perceived as failures have a difficult time attracting either. Unfortunately, the scale of the investments Apple made in its Newton in order to hasten the emergence of the PDA market made it very difficult to earn an attractive return. hence, the Newton came to be broadly viewed as a flop. 

## P151 Small markets cannot satisfy the near-term growth requirements of big organisations. 

P153 *Seagate technology was the second in the industry to develop a 3.5-inch drive in 1984.* Analysts at one point had speculated that Seagate might ship 3.5-inch drives as early as 1985; and indeed, Seagate showed a 10 MB model at the fall 1985 Comdex Show. When Seagate still had not shipped a 3.5-inch drive by late 1986, CEO Al Shugart explained, “*So far, there just isn’t a big enough market for it, as yet*” In 1987, when the 3.5-inch market at $1.6 billion had gotten “big enough to be interesting,” Seagate finally launched its offering. By 1991, however, even though Seagate had by then built substantial volume in 3.5-inch drives, *it had not yet succeeded in selling a single drive to a maker of portable computers*: Its models were all sold into the desktop market, defensively cannibalising its sales of 5.25-inch drives. Why?

P153 One likely *reason for this phenomenon* is that Conner Peripherals, which pioneered and maintained the lead in selling 3.5-inch drives to portable computer makers, fundamentally changed the way drive-makers had to approach the portables market. As one Conner executives described.

> From the beginning of the OEM disk drive industry, product development had proceeded in threes sequential steps. First you designed the drive; then you made it; and then you sold it. We chanted all that. We first sell the drives; then we design them; and then we build them  

P153 Conner executive, “Seagate was never able to figure out how to sell drives in the portable market. They just never got it”.

P154 Rather than continually working to convince and remind everyone that the small, disruptive technology might someday be significant or that it is at least strategically important, large companies should seek to *embed the project in an organisation that is small enough to be motivated* by the opportunity offered by a disruptive technology in its early years. This can be done either by *spinning out an independent organisation* or by *acquiring an appropriately small company.*

P155 There are many success stories to the credit of this approach. Control Data, for example, which had essentially missed the 8-inch disk drive generation, *sent a group to Oklahoma City to commercialise its 5.25-inch drive.* In addition to CDS’s need to *escape the power of its mainstream customers,* the firm explicitly wanted to create an organisation whose size matched the opportunity. “We needed on organisation,” reflected one manager, “*that could get excited about a $50,000 order*. In Minneapolis (which derived nearly $1 billion form the sale of 14-inch drives in the mainframe market) you needed a million-dollar order just to turn anyone’s head.” CDC’s Oklahoma City venture proved to be a significant success.  

> Own comment: Why Forex Club has never reached success on it’s new markets. Because all attempts were done during the best years of Forex Club. And external companies were fully dependent on internal resources of HQ. People at HQ were focused on the main and biggest markets (Russia), therefore they simply didn’t give a shit about new market. As Slava said: these top managers are getting crazy with their ideas, and we normal employees need to rescue our company’s future.  

P156 Modicon and TI were unable to sell their products to mainstream machine tool makers and HVAC contractors. AS performance was measured in the mainstream markets, *electronic products underperformed conventional controllers*, and few mainstream customers needed to programmable flexibility offered by electronic controllers. 

P157 What did Allen Bradley do differently? In 1969, just one year after Modicon entered the market, AB executives bought a 25 percent interest in Information Instruments, Inc. a fledging programmable controller start-up based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The following year it purchased outright a nascent division of Bunker Ramo, which was focused on programmable electronic controls and their emerging markets. AB combined these acquisitions into a single unit and maintained it as a business separate form its mainstream electromechanical products operation in Milwaukee. Over time, the electronic products have significantly eaten into the electromechanical business, as one AB division attacked the other. 

## P157 By contrast, each of the other four companies tried to manage its electronic controller business from within its mainstream electromechanical divisions, whose customers did not initially need or want electronic controls. Each failed to develop a viable position in the new technology. 
P157 J&J its huge Macneil and Janssen pharmaceuticals companies to small companies with annual revenues of less than $20 million. J&J’s strategy is to launch products of disruptive technologies though very small companies acquired for that purpose. 

P157 *It is not crucial for managers pursuing growth and competitive advantage to be leaders in every element of their business.* In sustaining technologies, in fact, evidence strongly suggest that companies which focus on extending performance of convention technologies, and choose to be followers in adopting new ones, can remain strong and competitive. This is not the case with disruptive technologies, however.  There are enormous returns and *significant first-mover advantages associated with early entry into the emerging markets* in which disruptive technologies are initially used. 

P158 Despite the evidence that leadership in commercialising disruptive technologies is crucial, large, successful innovators encounter a significant dilemma in the pursuit of such leadership. In addition to dealing with the power of present customers as discussed in the last chapter, large, growth-oriented companies face the problem that *small markets don’t solve the near-term growth needs of large companies.* The markets whose emergence is enabled by disruptive technologies all began as small ones. The first orders that the pioneering companies received in those markets were small ones. And the companies that cultivated those markets had to develop *cost structures enabling them to become profitable at small scale.* 

## Chapter 7: Discovering New and Emerging Markets
P166 Markets that do not exist cannot be analysed: Suppliers and customers must discover them together. Not only are the market applications for disruptive technologies /unknown/ at the time of their development, the are /unknowable/. *The strategies and plans that managers formulate for confronting disruptive technological change, therefore, should be plans for learning and discovery rather than plans for execution.*

P166 What the best executives in successful companies have learned about managing innovation is not relevant to disruptive technologies. 

## Most marketers, for example, have been schooled extensively, at universities and on the job, in the important art of listening to their customers, but few have any theoretical or practical training in how to discover markets that do not yet exists. 
P167 Over all, Disk/Trend has a remarkable track record in forecasting the future of established markets, but it has struggled to estimate accurately the size of new markets enabled by disruptive disk drive technologies.

P167 Of the five new architectures for which Disk/Trends forecasts were available, the 14-inch Winchester and the 2.5-inch generation were sustaining innovations, which were sold into the same value networks as the preceding generation of drives. The other three, 5.25-, 3.5-, and 1.8-inch drives, were disruptive innovation that facilitated the emergence of new value networks. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2406.JPG)

P168 The Disk/Trend staff used the same methods to generate the forecasts for sustaining architectures as they did for disruptive ones: interviewing leading customers and industry experts, trend analysis, economic modelling, and so on. T*he technique that worked so extraordinarily well when applied to sustaining technologies, however, clearly failed badly* when applied to markets or applications that did not yet exists. 

P169 The Kittyhawk (HP Disk Memory Devision) team concluded that developing a drive that met these customers’ requirements would be a demanding but feasible technological stretch, and they launched an aggressive twelve-month-effort to develop the tiny device. 

P170 *Although Kittyhawk’s technical development went according to plan, the development of applications for it did not.* The PDA market failed to materialise substantially, as sales of Apple’s Newton and competing devices fell far short of aspirations. This surprised many of the computer industry experts whose opinions HP’s marketers had worked so hard so synthesize. During its first two years on the market, Kittyhawk logged just a fraction of the sales that had been forecast. *Even more surprising, the applications that contributes most significantly to Kittyhawk’s sales were not in computers at all.* They were Japanese-language *portable word processors, miniature cash registers, electronic cameras, and industrial scanners,* none of which had figured in Kittyhawk’s original marketing plan.

P171 Unfortunately, because HP has positioned the drive with the expensive features needed for the PDA market *rather than designing it as a truly disruptive product, it simply could not meet the price required by home video game manufacturers.* 

## P172 The HP project managers concede in retrospect that their most serious mistake in managing the Kittyhawk initiative was to act as if their forecast about the market were right, rather than as if they were wrong. 

P172 If they had the opportunity to launch Kittyhawk all over again, they *would assume that neither they nor anyone else knew for sure what kinds of customers would want it or in what volumes.* This would lead them towards a much more exploratory, flexible approach toward product design and investment in manufacturing capacity; they would, given another chance, feel their way into the market, leaving enough resources to redirect their program if necessary and building upon what they learned on the way. (Pivot - Lean Startup)

P172 Honda employed a deliberate manufacturing strategy based on an experience curve in which it *cut prices, built volume, aggressively reduced costs, cut prices some more,* reduced costs further, and built an unassailable volume-based low-cost manufacturing position in the  motorcycle market. Honda then used that base *to move upmarket* and ultimately blew all established motorcycle manufacturers out of the market except for Harley-Davidson and BMW, which barely survived. 

P173 Honda engineers designed a fast, powerful motorcycle specifically for the American market, and in 1959 Honda dispatched three employees to Los Angeles to begin marketing efforts. To save living expenses, the three shared an apartment, and each brought with him a Supercub bike to provide cheap transportation. 

P174 Honda’s expenses in air-freighting the warranted replacement motorcycles between Japan and Los Angeles nearly sunk the company. 
*At one point Sears buyer tried to order Supercubs for the company’s outdoor power equipment departments, but Honda ignored the opportunity, preferring to focus on selling large, powerful, over-the-road cycles, a strategy that continued to be unsuccessful.* 

P174 *Finally, as more and more people clamoured for their won little Honda Supercubs to join their dirt-biking fiends,* the potential for a very different market dawned on Honda’s U.S. team: Maybe there was an undeveloped off-the-road recreational motorbike market in North America for which-quite by accident-the company’s little 50cc Supercub was nicely suited. Although it took much arguing and arm-twisting, the Los Angeles team ultimately convinced corporate management in japan that *while the company’s large bike strategy was doomed to failure, another quite different opportunity to create a totally new market segment* merited pursuit. 

### (make things that don’t scale)

P174 *Honda persuaded a few sporting goods dealers to take on its line of motorbikes, and as they began to promote the bikes successfully*, Honda’s innovative distribution strategy as born. The advertising slogan, “You meet the nicest people on a Honda,” for a paper he wrote in an advertising course. Encouraged by his teacher, he sold the idea to an advertising agency, which then convinced Honda to use it in what became an award-winning advertising campaign. 

P175 From its low-cost manufacturing base for reliable motorbikes, using a strategy reminiscent of the upmarket invasions described earlier in disk drives, steel, excavators, and retailing, Honda turned its sights upmarket, introduction between 1970 and 1988 a series of bikes with progressively more powerful engines. For time in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Harley attempted to compete head-on with HOnda and to capitalize on the expanding low-end market by producing a line of small-engine (150 to 300 cc) bikes acquired from the Italian motorcycle maker Aeromecchania. Harley attempted to sell the bikes through its North American dealer network. Although Honda’s manufacturing prowess clearly disadvantaged Harley in this effort, a primary cause of Harley’s failure to establish a strong presence in the small-bike value network was the opposition of its dealer network. Their profit margins were far greater missed Harley-Davidson’s image with their core customers. 

P175 Recall from chapter 2 the finding that within a given value network, the disk drive companies and their computer-manufacturing customers had developed very similar economic models or cost structures, which determined the sorts of business that appeared profitable to them.  We see the same phenomenon here. *Within their value network, the economics of Harley’s dealers drove them to favour the same type of business that Harley had come to favour.* *Their coexistence within the value network made it difficult for either Harley or its dealers to exit the network through its bottom.* 

P176 Interestingly, Honda proved just as *inaccurate in estimating how large the potential North American motorcycle market was* at it had been in understanding what it was. Is initial aspirations upon entry in 1959 had been to capture 10 percent of a market estimated at 550,000 units per year with annual growth of 5 percent. By 1957 the market had grown 16 percent per year to 5,000,000 annual units-units that came largely from an application that Honda could not have foreseen. 

P176 Intel transformed itself from a second-tier DRAM company into the world’s dominant microprocessor manufacturer. Mainstream as they seem today, microprocessors were disruptive technologies when they first emerged. Intel’s system for allocating production capacity operated according to a formula whereby capacity was committed in proportion to the gross margins earned by each product line. The system therefore imperceptibly began diverting investment capital and manufacturing capacity away from the DRAM business and into microprocessors-without an explicit management decisions to do so. 

## P178 Amid all the uncertainty surrounding disruptive technologies, managers, can always count on one anchor. /Experts’ forecasts will always be wrong./
P178 It is simply impossible to predict with any useful degree of precision how disruptive products will be used or how large their markets will be. An important corollary is that, because markets for disruptive technologies are unpredictable, *companies initial strategies for entering these markets will generally be wrong.* 

P179 *Many of the ideas prevailing at Intel about where the disruptive microprocessor could be used were wrong;* fortunately, Intel had not expended all of its resources implementing wrong-headed marketing plans while the right market direction was still unknowable. 

P179 Honda’s idea about how to enter the North American motorcycle market was wrong.

## P179 Research has shown, in fact, that the vast majority of successful new business ventures abandoned their original business strategies when they began implementing their initial plans and learned what would and would not work in the market. 

P179 Those that run out of resources or credibility before they can iterate toward a viable strategy are the ones that fail (Runrate / pivots left)

P179 Because failure is intrinsic to the process of finding new markets for disruptive technologies, the inability or unwillingness of individual managers to put their careers at risk acts as a powerful deterrent to the movement of established firms into the value networks created by those technologies. *“Pressure from the market reduces both the probability and the cost of being wrong”*

P180 Discovering markets for emerging technologies inherently involves failure, and most individual decision makers find it very difficult to risk backing a project that might fails because the market is not there. 

P180 Plans to learn versus plans to execute. Careful planning, followed by aggressive execution, is the right formula for success in sustaining technology. But in disruptive situations, action must be taken before careful plans are made. They must be plans for learning rather than plans for implementation (MVP).

P181 *Discovery-driven planning*, which requires managers to identify the assumptions upon which their business plans or aspirations are based, works well in addressing disruptive technologies. In the case of HP’s Kittyhawk disk drive for example, HP invested significant sums with its manufacturing partner, the Citizen Watch Company, in building and tooling a highly automated production line. This commitment was based on an assumption that the volumes PDA sales, were accurate. *Had HP’s managers instead assumed that nobody knew in what volume PDAs would sell, they might have built small modules of production capacity rather than a single, high-volume line.* (your initial assumptions are wrong, or the first draft of anything is shit)

P181 *Discovery-driven planning would have forced the team to test its market assumption before making commitments that were expensive to reverse-in this case*, possibly by creating a modularised design that easily could be reconfigured or defeatured to address different markets and price points, as events in the marketplace clarified the validity of their assumptions.  Philosophies such as management by objective and management by exception often impede the discovery of new markets because of where they focus management attention. 

P182 But as Honda’s experience in the North American motorcycle market illustrates, markets for disruptive technologies often emerge from unticipated successes, on which many planning systems do not focus the attention of senior management. *Such discoveries often come by watching how people use products, rather than by listening to what they say.* 

P182 I have come to call this approach to discovering the emerging market for disruptive technologies *agnostic marketing*, by which I mean marketing under an explicit assumption that no one-not us, not our customers-can know whether, how, or in what quantities a disruptive product can or will be used before they have experience using it. 

## Chapter 8: How to appraise your organization’s capabilities and disabilities

P185 Indeed, the hallmark of a great manager is the ability to identify the right person for the right job, and to train his or her employees so that they have the capabilities to succeed at the jobs they are given. 

P186 To succeed consistently, good managers need to be skilled not just in choosing, training, and motivating the right people for the right job, but in choosing, building and preparing the right organisation for the job as well. 

## P186 Only companies that succeeded in addressing disruptive technology were those that created independent organisations whose size matched the size of the opportunity. 

P186 Three classes of factors affect what an organisation can and cannot do, its resources, its processes, and its values.

### Resources
P186 Resources are the most visible of the factors that contribute to what an organisation can and cannot do. Resources include people, equipment, technology, product design, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually things, or assets-they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated and enhanced. 

P187 Resources are the things that managers most instinctively identify when assessing whether their organisations can successfully implement changes that confront them. 

### Processes

Organisations create value as employees transform inputs of resources-people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, energy, and cash-into product and services *of greater worth.* Processes define how an organisation transforms the sorts of inputs listed above into things of greater value. *Processes are defined or evolve de facto to address specific tasks.* This means that when managers use a process to execute the task for which it was designed, it is likely to perform efficiently. But when the same, seemingly efficient process is employed to tackle a very different task, it is likely to seem slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient. *In other words, a process that defines a capability in executing a certain task concurrently defines disabilities in executing other tasks.*

P188 The reason good managers strive for focus in their organisations is that processes and tasks can be readily aligned. *This means that the very mechanisms through which organisations create value are intrinsically inimical to change.* 

P188 The process that render good companies incapable of responding to change are often those that define how market research is habitually done; how such analysis is translated into financial projections; how plans and budgets are negotiated and how those numbers are delivered; and so on. These typically inflexible processes are where many organisations’s most serious disabilities in coping with change reside. 

### Values

P188 The values of an organisation are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made. Within the Resource-Process-Values (RPV) framework, values have a broader meaning. An organisation’s values are the standards by which employees make prioritization decisions-by which they judge whether an order is attractive or unattractive; whether a customer is more important or less important; whether an idea for a new product is attractive or marginal; and so on.  /(Example with Grekov and tablets = 500 leads per week, why we should spend resources on it)/

P189 Prioritization decision are made by employees at every level. At the executive tiers, they often take the form of decisions to invest or not invest in new products, services, and processes. Among salespeople, they consist of on-the-spot, day-to-day decisions about which products to push with customers and which not to emphasise. 

P189 The values of successful firms tend to evolve in a predictable fashion in at least two dimensions. *The first relates to acceptable gross margins.* As companies add features and functionality to their products and services in order to *capture more attractive customers in premium tiers of their markets, they often add /overhead cost/.*  As later a result, gross margins that at one point were quite attractive, at a later point seem unattractive. *Their values change.*

P190 For example, Toyota entered the North American market with its Corona model-a product targeting the lowest -priced tiers of the market. As the entry tiers of the market became crowded with look-alike models from Nissan, Honda, and Mazda, competition among equally low-cost competitors drove down profit margins. Toyota developed more sophisticated cars targeted at higher tiers of the market in order to improve its margins. Its Corolla, Camry, Previa, Avalon, and Lexus families of cars have been introduces in response to the same competitive pressures-*it kept its margins healthy by migrating up-market.*

P190 *The second dimensions along which values predictably change relates to how big a business has to be in order to be interesting.* Because a company’s stock price represents the discounter present values of its projected earnings stream, most managers typically feel compelled not just to maintain growth, but to maintain a constant rate of growth. In order for a $50 million company to grow 25 percent, it needs to find $10 million in new business the next year. For a $40 billion company to grow 25 percent, it needs to find $10 billion in new business the next year. The size of market opportunity that will solve each of these companies needs for growth is very different. 

P190 As noted in chapter 6, *an opportunity that excites a small organisation isn’t big enough to be interesting to a very large one.* One of the bittersweet rewards of success is, in fact that as companies become large, they literally lose the capability to enter small emerging markets. This disability is not because of a change in the resources within the companies-their resources typically are vast. Rather, it is because their values change.  *In many ways, HP’s recent decision to split itself into two companies is rooter in its recognition of this problem.* 

> Galkin mentioned in a skype call: “New markets are giving us almost zero revenue, in January we made $370.000 + CySec $150.000 if we look at Russia it’s almost nothing, because our organisation is to big to be excited about small wins.  

P191 The success rate of the established firms in developing and adopting sustaining technologies was 100 percent. The other five of these 116 technologies were disruptive innovations-in each case, smaller disk drives that were slower and had lower capacity than those used in the mainstream market. /There was no new technology involved in these disruptive products./ *Yet none of the industry’s leading companies remained atop the industry after these disruptive innovations entered the market-their batting average was zero.* 

P192 The leading disk drives companies had the resources-the people, money, and technology-required to succeed at both sustaining and disruptive technologies. But their processes and values constituted disabilities in their effort to succeed at disruptive technologies. 

P192 Large companies often surrender emerging growth markets because smaller, disruptive companies are actually more capable of pursuing them. Through startup lack resources, it doesn’t matter. Their values can embrace small markets, and their costs structures can accommodate lower margins. Their market research and resource allocation process allow managers to proceed intuitively rather than having to be backed up by careful research and analysis, presented in Power Point.  All of these advantages add up to enormous opportunity or looming disaster-depending upon your perspective. . Managers who face the need to change or innovate, therefore need to do more than assign the right resources to the problem. *They need to be sure that the organisation in which those resources will be working is itself capable of succeeding*-and in making that assessment, managers must scrutinise whether the organisation’s processes and values fit the problem. 

In the startup stages of an organisation, much of what gets done is attributable to its resource-it people. The addition or departure of a few key people can have a profound influence on its success. Over time, however, the locus of the organisation’s capabilities shifts toward its processes and values. As people work together successfully to address recurrent tasks, processes become defined. And as the business model takes shape and it becomes clear which types of business need to be accorded highest priority, values coalesce. In fact, one reason that many soaring young companies flame out after they go public based upon a hot initial product is that whereas their initial success was grounded in resources-the founding group of engineers-*the fail to create processes that can create a sequence of hot products.* 

# P193 In contrast, at highly successful firms such as McKinsey and Company, the processes and values have become so powerful that it almost doesn’t matter which people get assigned to which project teams. Hundreds of new MBAs join the firm every year, and almost as many leave. But the company is able to crank out high-quality work year after year because its core capabilities are rooted in its processes and values rather than in its resources. 
P194 As companies grow from a few employees to hundreds and thousands, the challenge of getting all employees to agree on what needs to be done and how it should be done so that the right jobs are done repeatedly and consistently can be daunting for even the best managers. *Culture is a powerful management tool in these situations.* Culture enables employees to act autonomously and causes them to act consistently.

## P195 Hence, the location of the most powerful factors that define the capabilities and disabilities of organisations migrates over time-from resources toward visible, conscious processes and values, and then toward culture.

P195 As long as the organisation continues to face the same sorts of problems that is processes and values were designed to address, managing the organisation is relatively straightforward. But because these factors also define what an organisation cannot do, they constitute disabilities when the problems facing the company change. When the organisation’s capabilities *reside primarily in its people, changing to address new problems is relatively simple.* But when the capabilities have come to reside in *processes and values and especially when they have become embedded in culture, change can become extraordinarily difficult.*

P196 New computer designs, comprised of modular components, had to be completed in six-to twelve-month cycles. The computers were manufactured in high-volume assembly lines, and sold through retailers to consumers and businesses. None of these processes required to compete successfully in the personal computer business existed within DEC. In other words, although the people working at DEC, as individuals, had the abilities to design, build, and sell personal computers profitably, they were working in an organisation that was incapable of doing this because its processes had been designed and had evolved to do other tasks well. *The very processes that made the company capable of succeeding in one business rendered in incapable of succeeding in another.*

P196 And what about DEC’s values? *Because of the overhead costs* that were required to succeed in the minicomputer business, DEC had to adopt a set of values that essentially dictated, “if it generates 50 percent gross margins or more, it’s good business. If it generates less than 40 percent margins, it’s not worth doing.” Management had to ensure that all employees *prioritised project according to this criterion*, or the company couldn’t make money.  

## P197 Despite beliefs spawned by popular change-management and reengineering programs, processes are not nearly as flexible or “trainable” as are resources-and values are even less so. 

P197 Manager who determine that an organisation’s capabilities aren’t suited for a new task, are faced with three options through which to create new capabilities. They can:
1. Acquire a different organisation whose processes and values are a close match with the new task
2. Try to change the processes and values of the current organisation
3. Separate out an independent organisation and develop within in the new processes and values that are required to solve the new problem. 

## P198 If the acquired company’s processes and values are the real driver of its success, then the last thing the acquiring manager wants to do is to integrate the company into the new parent organisation. (Chrysler, Rolm)

## P198 If on the other hand, the company’s resources were the primary rationale for the acquisition, then integration the firm into the parent can make a lot of sense-essentially plugging the acquired people, product, technology, and customers into the parent’s processes as a way of leveraging the parent’s existing capabilities.  (Polar app = Luke Wroblewski, Talent Acquisition = check examples where companies buy services and close them down, and put the team to work on other products)
### Trello example: they could build the same product, they have the same people, they have the technology, they don’t need their customers too small, why to acquire than? Because of their processes and values and also potential threat for the future!

P198 The perils of the DaimerChrysler merger that began in the late 1990s, for example, can be better understood through the RPV model. Chrysler had few resources that could be considered unique in comparison to its competitors. Its success in the market of the 1990s was rooted in its processes-particularly in its rapid, creative product design processes, and in its processes of integrating the efforts of its subsystem suppliers. What would be the best way for Daimler to leverage the capabilities that Chrysler brought to the table. Wall street exerted nearly inexorable pressure on management to consolidate the two organisations in order to cut costs. However, integrating the two companies would likely vaporise the key processes that made Chrysler such an attractive acquisition in the first place. 

P198 The situation is reminiscent of IBM’s 1984 acquisition of Rolm. there wasn’t anything in Rolm’s pool of resources that IBM didn’t already have. It was Rolm’s processes for developing PBX products and for finding new markets for them that was really responsible for its success. In 1987 IBM decided to fully integrate the company into its corporate structure. Trying to push Rolm’s resources-its products and its customers-through the same processes that were honed in its large computer business, caused the Rolm business to stumble badly. And inviting executives of a computer company whose values had been whetted on operating profit margins of 18 percent to get excited about prioritising products with operating margins below 10 percent was impossible. IBM’s decision to integrate ROlm actually destroyed the very source of the original worth of the deal. 

P199 In contrast, Cisco System’s acquisitions process has worked well-because its managers seem to have kept resources, processes and values in the right perspective. Between 1993 and 1997 it acquired primarily small companies that were less than two years old: early-stage organisations whose market value was built primarily upon their resources-particularly engineers and products. Cisco has a well-defined, deliberate process by which it essentially plugs these resources into the parent’s processes and systems, and it has a carefully cultivated method of keeping the engineers of the acquired company happily on the Cisco payroll. In the process of integration, Cisco throws away whatever nascent processes and values came with the acquisition-becasue those weren’t what Cisco paid for. On a couple of occasions when the company acquired a larger, more mature organization-notably its 1996 acquisition of StrataCom-Cisco did not integrate. it let StrataCom stand alone, and infused its substantial resources into the organisation to help it grow at a more rapid rate. 

P200 Creating new capabilities internally. Too often, however, resources such as these are then plugged into fundamentally unchanged processes-and little change results. For example, through the 1970s and 1980s Toyota upended the world automobile industry through its innovation in development, manufacturing, and supply-chain processes-without investing aggressively in resources such as advanced manufacturing or information-processing technology. General Motors responded by investing nearly $60 billion in manufacturing resources-computer-automated equipment that was designed to reduce cost and improve quality. Using state-of-the-art resources in antiquated processes, however, made little difference in General Motor’s performance, because it is in its processes and values that the organisation’s most fundamental capabilities lie. Processes and values define how resources-many of which can be bought and sold, hired and fired-are combined to create value. 

P201 Unfortunately, *processes are very hard to change-for two reasons.* The first is that organisation boundaries are often drawn to facilitate the operation of present processes. Those boundaries can impede the creation of new processes that cut across those boundaries. When new challenges require different people or groups to interact differently than they habitually have done-addressing different challenges with different timing than historically had been required-*managers need to pull the relevant people out of the existing organisation and draw a new boundary around a new group*. New team boundaries enable or facilitate new patterns of working together that ultimately can coalesce as new processes-new capabilities for transforming inputs into outputs. *Professors Steven C Wheelwright and Kim B Clark have called these structures heavyweight teams.* 

P201 The second reason new process capabilities are hard to develop is that, in some cases, mangers don’t wan to throw the existing processes out-the methods work perfectly well in doing what they were designed to do. As noted above, while resources tend to be flexible and can be used in a variety of situations, processes and values are by their very nature inflexible. *Their very raison d’etre is to cause the same thing to do consistently, over and over again. Processes are meant not to change.* 

P202 *If a company needs to do both types of tasks (sustaining and disruptive innovation) simultaneously, then it needs two very different processes.* And it is very difficult for a single organisational unit to employ fundamentally different, opposing processes. As shown below, this is why managers need to create different teams, within which different processes to address new problems can be defined and refined. 

P202 *Creating capabilities through a spin-out organisation. A separate organisation is required when the mainstream organisation’s values would render it incapable of vouching resources on the innovation project.* Large organisations cannot be expected to allocate freely the critical financial and human resources needed to build a strong position in small, emerging markets. And it is very difficult for a whose *cost structure is tailored to competent in high-end markets* to be profitable in low-end markets as well. When a threatening disruptive technology requires a different cost structure in order to be profitable and competitive, or when the *current size of the opportunity is insignificant* relative to the growth needs of the mainstream organisation, then-and only then-is a spin-out organisation a required part of the solution. 

P202 How separate does the effort need to be? The primary requirement is that the project cannot be forced to compete with projects in the mainstream organisation for resources. Because values are the criteria by which prioritization decisions are made, project that are inconsistent with a company’s mainstream values will naturally be accorded lowest priority. Whether the independent organisation is physically separate is less important is its independence from the normal resource allocation process. In our studies of this challenge, we have never seen a company succeed in addressing a change that disrupts its mainstream values absent the personal, attentive oversight of the CEO-precely because of the power of processes and values and particularly the logic of the normal resource allocation. Only the CEO can ensure that new organisation gets the required resources and is free to create processes and values that are appropriate to the new challenge. CEOs who view spin-outs as a tool to get disruptive threats off of their personal agendas are almost creation to meet with failure. We have seen no exceptions to this rule. The framework summarised in Figure 8.1 can help managers exploit the capabilities that reside in their current processes and values when that is possible, and to create new ones, when the preset organisation is incapable. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2407.JPG)

P204 *Heavyweight teams are tools to create new processes*-new ways of working together that constitute new capabilities. In these teams, members do not simply represent the interest and skill of their function. They are charged to act like general managers, and reach decisions and make trade-offs for the good of the project. hey typically are dedicated and colocated. 

P204 At the other extreme, however, if there is a strong (values), sustaining fir, then the manager can expect that the energy and resources of the mainstream organisation will coalesce behind it. There is no reason for a skunk works or a spinout-in such a case. 

P205 Region A in Figure 81. depicts a situation in which a manger is faced with a breakthrough but sustaining technological change-it it fits in the organisation’s value. 

P205 In Region B, where the project fits the company’s processes and values, a lightweight development team can be successful. In such teams coordination across functional boundaries occurs within the mainstream organisation. 

P205 Region C denotes an area in which a manager is faced with a disruptive technological change that doesn’t fit the organisation’s existing processes and values. To ensure success in such instances, managers should create an autonomous organisation and commission a heavyweight development team to tackle the challenge. 

## P205 In addition to the examples cited in chapters 5,6 and 7, many companies efforts to address the distribution channel conflicts created by the Internet should be managed by this manner.
P206 In 1999 Compaq Computer, for example, launched a business to market its computer direct to customers over the Internet, so that it could compete more effectively with Dell Computer. Within a few weeks its retailers had protested so loudly that Compaq had to back away from the strategy. This was very disruptive to the values, or profit model of the company and its retailers. *The only way it could manage this conflict would be to launch the direct business through an independent company.* It might even need a different brand in order to manage the tension. (Example at Forex Club with Binary Option failed project, Libertex still trying to figure out the model after 3 years of release)

P206 Region D typifies projects in which products or services similar to those in the mainstream need to be sold within a fundamentally lower overhead costs business mode. Wal-Mart’s Sam’s Clubs would fit in this region. These, in fact, can leverage similar logistics management processes as the main company, but budgeting, management and P&L responsibly needs to be different.  Functional and lightweight teams are appropriate vehicles for exploiting established capabilities, whereas heavyweight teams are tools for creating new ones. 

P206 Spin-out organisations, similarly, are tools for forging new values. Unfortunately, most companies employ a one-size-fits-all organising strategy, using lightweight teams for programs of every size and character. Among those few firms that have accepted the “heavyweight gospel,” many have attempted to organise all of their development teams in a heavyweight fashion.  Ideally, each company should tailor the team structure and organisation location to the process and values required by each project. 

# In many ways, the disruptive technologies model is a theory of relativity, because what is disruptive to one company might have a sustaining impact on another. 
P207 For example, dell Computer began by selling computers over the telephone. for Dell, the initiative to begin selling and accepting order over the Internet was a sustaining innovation. It helped it make more money in the way it was already structured. For Compaq, HP, and IBM, however, marketing direct to customers over the Internet would have a powerfully disruptive impact. The same is true in stock brokerage. *For discount brokers such as Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, which accepted most of their orders by telephone, trading securities on-line simply helped them discount more cost-effectively-and even offer enhanced service relative to their former capabilities. For full-service firms with commissioned brokers such as Merrill Lynch, however, on-line trading represents a powerful disruptive threat.*

P207 Manger whose organisation are confronting change must first determine that they have the resources required to succeed. They then need to ask a separate questions: does the organisation have the processes and values to succeed? Asking this second question is not as instinctive for most managers because the processes by which work is done and the values by which employees make their decisions have served them well.  The very capabilities of their organisations also define their disabilities. *Are the processes by which work habitually gets done in the organisation appropriate for this new problem? And will the values of the organisation cause this initiative to get high priority, or to languish?*

P209 The reason why innovation often seems to be so difficult for established firms is that they employ *highly capable people, and then set them to work within processes and values* that weren’t designed to facilitate success with the task at hand. Ensuring that capable people are ensconced in capable organisations is a major management responsibility in an age such as ours, when the ability to cope with accelerating change has become so critical. 

P211 The graphs in this book showing the intersecting technology and market trajectories have proven useful in explaining how leading firms can stumble from positions of industry leadership. In each of the several industries explored, technologists were able to provide rates of performance improvement that have exceeded the rates of performance improvement that the market has needed or was able to absorb. 

## P211*Historically, when this performance oversupply occurs, it creates an opportunity for a disruptive technology to emerge and subsequently to invade established markets from below.* 

## P211 As it creates this threat or opportunity for a disruptive technology, performance oversupply also triggers a fundamental change in the basis of competition in the product’s market: The rank-ordering of the criteria by which customers choose one product or service over another will change, signalling a transition form one phase (variously defined by management theorists) to the next of the product life cycle. > Crossing the chasm!
P211 Because of this, trajectory maps such as those used in this book usefully characterise how an industry’s competitive dynamics and its basis of competition are likely to change over time. 

# Chapter 9
P211 Historically, when this performance oversupply occurs, it creates an opportunity for a disruptive technology to emerge and subsequently to invade established markets from below. 

P214 Performance oversupply triggered a change in the basis of competition. Once the demand for capacity was satiated, other attributes, whose performance had not yet satisfied market demands, came to be more highly valued and to constitute the dimensions along which drive markers sought to differentiate their products. In concepts, this meant that the most important attribute measured on the vertical axis of figures such as 8.1 changed, and that new trajectories of product performance, compared to market demands, took shape. Specifically, in the desktop personal computer marketplace between 1986 and 1988, the smallness of the drive began to matter more than other features. 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2558.JPG)


P215 Generally, once the performance level demanded of a particular attribute has been achieved, customers indicate their satiation by being less willing to pay a premium price for continued improvement in that attribute.

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2559.JPG)


P217 A product becomes a commodity within a specific market segment when the repeated changes in the basis of competition, as described above, completely place themselves out, that is, when market needs on each attribute or dimension of performance have been fully satisfied by more than one available product. But differentiation loses its meaning when the features and functionality have exceeded what the market demands. 

P218 Initially, when no available product satisfied the functionality requirements the market, the basis of competition, or the criteria by which product choice is made, tends to be product functionality. Once two or more products credibly satisfy the market#s demand for functionality, however, customers can no longer base their choice of products on functionality, but tend to choose a product and vendor based on reliability. As long as market demand for reliability exceeds what vendors are able to provide, customer choose products on this basis-and the most reliable vendors of the most reliable products earn a premium for it. But when to or more vendors improve to the point that they more than satisfy the reliability demanded by the market, the basis of competition shifts to convenient to use and those vendors that are most convenient to deal with. Again, as long as the market demand choose products on this basis and reward vendors with premium prices for the convenience they offer. Finally, when multiple vendors offer a package of convenient products and services that fully satisfies market market demand, the basis of competition shifts to price. The factor driving the transition from one phase of the buying hierarchy to the next performance oversupply. 

P219 First, the attributes that make disruptive products worthless in mainstream markets typically become their strongest selling points in emerging markets; and second, disruptive products tend to be simpler, cheaper, and more reliable and convenient that established products. 

P220 Thus Seagate’s marketers took the firms’ early 3.5-inch drives to IBM for evaluation, rather than asking, “Where is the market that would actually value a smaller, lower-capacity drive?” When Bucyrus Erie acquired its Hydrohoe hydraulic excavator line in 1951, its manager apparently did not ask, “Where is the market that actually wants a mobile excavator that can only dig narrow trenches?” They applied to a disruptive  innovation a way of thinking appropriate to a sustaining technology. In the instances studies in this book, established firms confronted with disruptive technology typically viewed their primary development challenge as a technological one: to improve the disruptive technology enough that it suits known markets. In contrast, the firms that were most successful in commercialising a disruptive technology were those framing their primary development challenge as a marketing one: to build or find a market where product competition occurred along dimensions that favoured the disruptive attributes of the product.  These latter firms, by creating a commercial base and then moving upmarket, will ultimately address the mainstream market much more effectively than will firms that have framed disruptive technology as a laboratory, rather than a marketing challenge. 

P221 When performance oversupply has occurred and a disruptive technology attacks the underbelly of a mainstream market, the disruptive technology often succeeds both because it satisfied the market’s needs for functionality, in terms of the buying hierarchy, and because it is simpler, cheaper, and more reliable and convenient than mainstream products. 

P222 Because established companies are so prone to push for high-performance, high-profit products and markets, they find it very difficult not to overload their first disruptive products with features and functionality. 

## P222 Quicken. Quicken dominates its market because it is easy and convenient. Its makers pride themselves on the fact that the vast majority of Quicken customers simply buy the program, boot it up on their computers, and begin using it without having to read the instruction manual. Its developers made it so convenient to use, and continue to make it simpler and more convenient, by watching how customers use the products, not by listening to what they or the “experts” say they need. By watching for small hints of where the product might be difficult or confusing to use, the developers direct their energies towards a progressively simpler, amore convenient product that provides adequate, rather than superior, functionality. 

P223 Scott Cook, Intuit’s founder, decided that the makers of accounting software for small businesses had overshot the functionality required by that market, thus creating an opportunity for a disruptive software technology that provided adequate but not superior functionality (and which was simple and convenient to use). Quickbooks proceeded to capture 70% of the market within two years of its introduction.

P224 “ In retrospect”, noted a Lilly research, “the market was not terribly dissatisfied with pork insulin. In fact, it was pretty happy with it. Lilly had spent enormous capital and organisation energy overshooting the market’s demand for product purity. Once again. this was a differentiated product to which the market did not accord a price premium because the performance it provided exceeded what the market demanded. 

## P225 Lilly’s and Novo’s experiences offer further proof that a product whose performance exceeds market demands suffers commodity-like pricing, while disruptive products that redefine the basis of competition command a premium. 
P226 What is obvious in retrospect might not be at all obvious in the thick of battle. Influence of leading customers is a major reason why companies product development trajectories overshoot the demands of mainstream markets.

P230 Microsoft’s Excel spreadsheet software, for example, required 1.2 MB of disk storage capacity in its version 1.2, released in 1987. Its version 5.0, released in 1995, required 32 MB of disk storage capacity. Some industry observers believe that if a team of developers were to watch typical users, they would find that functionality has substantially overshot mainstream market demands. If true, this could create an opportunity for a disruptive technology-applets picked off the internet and used in simple internet appliances rather than in full-function computers, for example- to invade this market from below. 


## P231 Most well-run companies migrate unconsciously to the northeast, setting themselves up to be caught by a change in the basis of competition and an attack from below by disruptive technology. 

# Chapter 10: Managing Disruptive Technological Change: A Case Study
P235 But we have learned here that even the best managers are subject to certain laws that make disruptive innovation difficult. It is when great managers haven’t understood or have attempted to fight these forces that their companies have stumbled. 

## P236 To measure market needs, I would watch carefully what customers do, not simply listen to what they say. Watching how customers actually use a product provides much more reliable information than can be gleaned from a verbal interview or a focus group. (that’s why we need to learn to scale MVP process)
P237 This information is not sufficient to characterise electric vehicles as disruptive, however. They will only be disruptive if we find that they are also on a trajectory of improvement that might someday make them competitive in parts of the mainstream market. To assess this possibility, we need to project trajectories measuring the performance improvement demanded in the market versus the performance improvement electric vehicles technology may provide. If these trajectories are parallel, then electric vehicles are unlikely to become factors in the mainstream market; but if the technology will progress faster than the pace of improvement demanded in the market, then the threat of disruption is real! 

![](The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/The%20innovator%E2%80%99s%20Dilemma%20(Book%20Summary)/IMG_2561.JPG)


P237 In other words, as an automotive company executive, I would worry about the electric vehicle, not just because it is politically correct to be investing in environmentally friendly technologies, but because electric vehicles have the smell of a disruptive technology. 

P239 Because electric vehicles are not sustaining innovations, however, mainstream automakers naturally doubt that there is a market for them-another symptom of a disruptive innovation. Consider this statement by the director of Fords electric vehicle program: “The electric Ranger will sell at approximately $30,000 and have a lead-acid battery that will give it a range of 50 miles. 

# Where is the market for electric vehicles?
P240 First, I would acknowledge that, by definition, electric vehicles cannot initially be used in mainstream applications because they don’t satisfy the basic performance requirements of that market.  Nonetheless, my task is to find a market in which the vehicles can be used, because the early entrants into disruptive technology markets develop capabilities that constitute strong advantages over later entrants. 

P241 Odd as it sounds, therefore, I would direct my marketers to focus on uncovering somewhere a group of buyers who have an undiscovered need for a vehicle that accelerates relatively slowly and can’t be drive farther than 100 miles! The second point on which I would base my marketing approach is that no one can learn from market research what the early market(s) for electric vehicles will be. I can hire consultants, but the only thing I can know for sure is that their findings will be wrong. 

## P241 The only useful information about the market will be what I create through expeditions into the market, through testing and probing, trial and error, by selling real products to real people who pay real money. 
P241 The third point is that my business plan must be a plan for learning. I must therefore plan to be wrong and to learn what is right as fast as possible.

P242 What might emerge as the initial value network for electric vehicles? Again, through it is impossible to predict, it almost surely will be one in which the weaknesses of the electric vehicle will be seen as strengths. 

P243 Because of the way Chrysler has positioned its electric vehicle, industry analysts naturally compare it to gasoline-powered minivans, using the metrics paramount in the mainstream value network. At an estimated costs of 100,000 (compared with $22,000 for the gasoline-powered model), nobody in their right mind would consider buying Chrysler’s product. 

P244 Chrysler’s conclusion is absolutely correct, given the way its marketers have framed their challenge. Mainstream customers can never use a disruptive technology its outset. 

P244 Historically, performance oversupply opens the door for simpler, less expensive, and more convenient-and almost always disruptive-technologies to enter. 

P244 This is borne out by the nature of the most successful entrants into the North American market during the past thirty years; they have succeeded not because they introduced products with superior functionality, but because they competed on the basis of reliability and convenience,. Toyota, for example, entered the U.A. market with its simple, reliable Corona, establishing a low-end market position. Then, consistent with the inexorable attraction to migrate upmarket, Toyota introduced models, such as Campry, Previa, and Lexus, with added features and functionality, creating a vacuum at the low end of the market into which entrants such as Saturn and Hyundai have entered. Saturn’s strategy has been to characterise the customer’s entire experience of buying and owning the vehicle as reliable and convenient, but it, too, judging by recent reports, will soon take its turn moving upmarket, creating a new vacuum at the low end for even simpler, more convenient transportation. 

P245 Using these qualities as my guiding principle, I would instruct my design engineers to proceed according to the following there criteria: 

1. First, this vehicle must be simple, reliable, and convenient.
2. Second, because no one knows the ultimate market for the product or how it will ultimately be used, we must design a product platform in which feature, function, and styling changes can be made quickly and at low costs. 
3. Third, we must hit a low price point. Disruptive technologies typically have a lower sticker price per unit than products that are used in the mainstream, even through their costs in use is often higher. 

P246 Accordingly, our electric vehicle must have a lower sticker price than the prevailing price for gasoline-powered cars, even if the operating cost per mile driven is higher. Customers have a long track of record of paying price premiums for convenience. 

P246 Our technology plan cannot call for any technological breakthroughs on the path critical for the project’s success. Historically, disruptive technologies involve no new technologies, rather, they consists of components built around proven technologies and put together in a novel product architecture that offers the customer a set of attributes never before available. 

P247 The reason these companies view a breakthrough in battery technology as the critical bottleneck to the commercial success of electric vehicles, of course, is that their executives have positioned their minds and their products in the mainstream market. For Chrysler, this means an electric minivan; for Ford, en electric Ranger. 

P247 The companies that ultimately achieve the advances in battery technology required to power cards fro 150-mile cruises (if they are ever developed) will be those that pioneer the creation of a new value network using proves technology and then develop the sustaining technologies needed to carry them upward into more attractive markets. 

P248 Honda’s disruptive motorbikes were rejected by mainstream motorcycle dealers, forcing the company to create a new channel among sporting goods retailers. We saw, in fact, that a major reason why Harley-Davidson’s small-bike initiative failed is that its dealers rejected it: The image and economics of the small Italian bikes Harley had acquired did not fit its dealer network.

P248 My electric vehicle program would, therefore, have as a basic strategic premise the need to find or create a new distribution channels for electric vehicles. Unless proven otherwise, I’d bet that mainstream dealers of gasoline-powered automobiles would not view the sorts of disruptive electric vehicles we have in mind as critical to their success. 

P249 HP desk-jet initiative all succeeded because  they created organisations whose *survival* was predicated upon successful commercialisation of the disruptive technology. 

P250 In an independent organisation, my best employees would be able to focus on electric vehicles without being repeatedly withdrawn from the project to solve pressing problems for customers who pay the present bill. 

P250 If we are lucky enough to get a few wins, they almost surely will be small ones. In a small, independent organisation, these small wins will generate energy and enthusiasm. In the mainstream, they would generate scepticism about whether we should even be in the business. I wan my organisation’s customers to answer the question of whether we should be in the business. I don’t want to spend my precious managerial energy constantly defending our existence to efficiency analysts in the mainstream. 

P252 We will, therefore, need the flexibility to fail, but to fail on a small scale, so that we can try again without having destroyed our credibility. Again, there are two ways to create the proper tolerance towards failure: change the values and culture of the mainstream organisations or create a new organisation. 

## P252 I want them to feel constant pressure to find some way-some set of customers somewhere-to make our small organisation cash-positive as fast as possible. We need a strong motivation to accelerate through the trials and errors inherent in cultivating a new markets. 

P252 In other words, the degree of disruptiveness inherent in a n innovation provides a fairly, clear indication of when a mainstream organisation might be capable of succeeding with it and when it might be expected to fail. 

P252 Hence, my project would need to be managed as a heavyweight team in an organisation independent of the mainstream company. This organisational structure cannot guarantee the success of our electric vehicle program, but it would at least allow my team to work in an environment that accounts for, rather than fights, the principles of disruptive innovation. 

## P257 One of the most gratifying outcomes of the research reported in this book is the finding that managing better, working harder, and not making so many dumb mistakes is not the answer to innovators dilemma. 

P257 The vast majority of the innovation channels they will face are sustaining in character, and these are just the sort of innovations that these capabilities are designed to tackle. manager of these companies simply needed to recognise these capabilities, cultures, and practices are valuable only in certain conditions. 

P258 I have found that many of the life’s most useful insights are often quite simple. In retrospect, many of the finding of this book fit that mode: Initially they seemed somewhat counterintuitive, but as I came to understand them, *the insights were revealed as simple and sensible.*

P258 This means, however, that until other alternatives that appear to be financially more attractive have disappeared or been eliminated, mangers will find it extraordinarily difficult to keep resources focused on the pursuit of a disruptive technology. 

P259 Historically, the more successful approach has been to find a new market that values the current characteristics of the disruptive technology. Disruptive technology should be framed as a marketing challenge, not a technological one. Fourth, the capabilities of most organisations are far more specialised and context-specific than most managers are inclined to believe. This is because capabilities are forged within value networks. 

P259 All of these capabilities-of organisations and of individuals-are defined and refined by the types of problems tackled in the past, the nature of which has also been shaped by the characteristics of the value networks in which the organisations and individuals have historically competed. Very often, the new markets enabled by disruptive technologies require very different capabilities along each of these dimensions. 

## P259 Fifth, in many instances, the information required to make large and decisive investments in the face of disruptive technology simply does not exists. It needs to be created through fast, inexpensive, and flexible forays into the market and the product. The risk is very high that any particular idea about the product attributes or market application of a disruptive technology may not prove to be viable. (MVP) Failure and interactive learning are, therefore, intrinsic to the search for success with a disruptive technology. 
P260 Managers who don’t bet the farm on their first idea, who leave room to try, fail, learn quickly, and try again, can succeed at developing the understanding of customers, markets, and technology needed to commercialise disruptive innovations. 

## P260 Disruptive innovations entail significant first-mover advantages: Leadership is important. sustaining situations, however, very often do not. 
P260 Perhaps the most powerful protection that small entrants firms enjoy as they build the emerging markets for disruptive technologies is that they are doing something that it simply does not make sense for the established leaders to do. 

P261 Good managers have a genuinely hard time doing what does not fit their model for how to make money. Because disruptive technologies rarely make sense during the years when investing in them is most important, conventional managerial wisdom at established firms constitutes an entry and mobility barrier that entrepreneurs and investors can bank on. It is powerful and pervasive. 

P263 Why do well-managed companies fail? He concludes that they often fail because the very management practices that have allowed them to become industry leaders also make it extremely difficult for them to develop the disruptive technologies that ultimately steal away their markets. 

P264 But disruptive technologies have other attributes that a few fringe (generally new) customers value. They are typically cheaper, smaller, simpler, and frequently more convenient to use. *Therefore they open new markets.*

*P264 Principles of disruptive technology*
1. Companies depend on customers and investors for resources
2. Small markets don’t solve the growth needs of large companies
3. Markets that don’t exist can’t be analyzed
4. Technology supply may not equal market demand

## P266 A big mistake that mangers make in dealing with new technologies is that they try to fight or overcome the Principles of Disruptive Technology
P266 Specifically, he advises managers faced with disruptive technologies to:  
1. Give responsibility for disruptive technologies to organisations whose customers need them so that resources will flow to them. 
2. Set up a separate organisation small enough to get excited by small gains. 
3. Plan for failure. Don’t bet all your resources on being right the first time. Think of your initial efforts at commercialising a disruptive technology as learning opportunities. Make revisions as you gather data. 
4. Don’t count on breakthroughs. Move ahead early and find the market for the current attributes of the technology. you will find it outside the current mainstream market. You will also find that the attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive to mainstream markets are the attributes on which the new markets will be built. 

*P267 The characteristics of a disruptive technology are:*
* They are simpler and cheaper and lower performing. 
* They generally promise lower margins, not higher profits. 
* Leading firm’s most profitable customers generally can’t use and don’t want them.
* They are first commercialised in emerging or insignificant markets. 

1. There is a tendency in all markets for companies to move upmarket toward more complicated products with higher prices. 
2. The same tendency for companies to move upmarket that can be fatal for established companies also accounts for the eventual development of emerging markets into mainstream markets.
3. In attempting to commercialise a disruptive technology, why is it important to begin investing on the assumption that your expectations will be wrong. 
4. One of the hallmarks of disruptive technologies is that initially they underperform the current technology on the attribute that matter most to mainstream customers. The companies that succeeded in commercialising them, therefore must find different customers for whom the new technology’s attributes are most valuable. 
5. When two or more products meet the minimum specifications for the functionality of a product, customers begin to look for other deciding factors. According to a Windermere Associates study cited in the book, the progression usually is from functionality to reliability to convenience to price.  (if it comes to price, so there is already vacuum in innovation)
6. Most people think that senior executives make the important decisions about where a company will go and how it will invest its resources, but the real power lies with the people deeper in the organisation who decide which proposals will be presented to senior management. 
7. What are the personal career considerations that lead ambitious employees in large corporations to ignore or kill disruptive technologies? Should well-managed companies change the policies that encourage employees to think this way? 
8. What do the findings in this book suggest about how companies will be organised in the future? Should large organisation with structured created around functionalities redesign themselves into interconnected teams, as some management theorists currently believe? 
9. The CEO of a disk-drive maker is quoted in Chapter 4 as saying that “We got way ahead of the market” in explaining why his company failed to commercialise a 1.8-inch disk drive that it had developed. At the time, however, there was a burgeoning market for 1.8-inch drives among new users that his company hadn’t discovered. Professor Christensen argues that “*disruptive technology should be framed as a marketing challenge, not a technological one.”* 
10. Similarly, Professor Christensen argues that companies should not wait for new breakthroughs to improve a technology’s performance. Instead, they need to find customers who value the very attributes that others consider to be shortcomings. 
11. Well-managed companies fail because they are well managed.
