The innovator's Manifesto Summary

What Is “Disruption Theory?”

Disruption theory explains how innovations triumph and how they displace existing market leaders. To understand how it works, it helps to know that a market theory can be  “explanatory” and describe why something happens, or it can be “predictive” and try to forecast what will happen, even without making any particular claims about being true. You cannot test an explanatory theory since it is designed to “address a fixed and unchanging past.” But you can test a predictive theory by using experimentation. You  define a situation, predict an outcome and follow the results. You can strictly control this process, as in a physics lab, or just observe it, perhaps by watching as a new business either succeeds or fails in a given market.

“‘Disruption’...is a theory of innovation – of how particular types of new products and services, or ‘solutions,’ come to achieve success or dominance in markets, often at the expense of incumbent providers.”
Disruption theory offers more accurate than you might expect “predictive power” about which new businesses may work and which ones may not. This theory can help entrepreneurs hone their plans, investors guide their buys, executives select acquisition targets and managers assess potentially disruptive outside innovation.

“Translating Disruption into the ‘trade-off’ language of microeconomics and strategy provides a more precise understanding of the causal mechanisms of Disruption.”
Corporate strategists can apply disruption theory without extensive research into other elements that traditionally shape business planning, such as evaluating an organization’s leaders, determining how the firm fits the market, assessing how strong the company is or even if its market is growing. Disruption theory is applicable in forecasting without addressing these factors because the theory reduces the act of prediction to a logic tree with simple choices. Is a new business bringing an innovation to market? Is the innovation “sustaining” or “disruptive”? With a sustaining innovation that builds on factors the market has already tested, “incumbent” companies have the advantage. With a disruptive innovation, the advantage goes to “autonomous” companies, especially start-ups with no vested interest in the status quo. For a firm where you can evaluate these factors in retrospect, disruption theory can shed light on past wins and failures.

“Prediction and explanation require very different sorts of evidence and rules of inference.”
The idea that you can make superior predictions based on so few factors seems surprising, but tests forecasting the success or failure of 48 businesses (the list included five successes and 43 failures) proved its effectiveness. In an initial experiment, those using disruption theory picked four of the successful businesses and 41 of the failures. Since one test cannot prove a theory, researchers conducted similar experiments at MIT, Harvard Business School and the University of Western Ontario. The test used uniform case studies of each of the 48 businesses, describing their financials, markets, management and the nature of each company. Researchers first gave students six random case histories and asked them to predict those firms’ success or failure. The students then learned about disruption theory. Afterward, they forecast the success or failure of a second set of six firms. Their ability to predict correctly improved by 50%. Strikingly, forecasting abilities improved the most among some of the students who received the least instruction.

“Consistent and industry-leading innovation can be a formula for long-term success.”
Southwest Airlines demonstrates disruption theory’s explanatory powers. While the airline had a strong inception as a “low-cost carrier” in 1980, it declined from 1980 to 1991 only to then turn things around and experience 10 years of intense growth. To be convincing, a business theory has to be able to explain such a reversal and turnaround. In fact, disruption theory can elucidate what happened. Southwest’s business model before its great growth and profitability had several distinguishing innovative characteristics, such as focusing on niche markets and abandoning the major airlines’ “hub-and-spoke” traffic model. Yet those innovations were not enough to reconfigure the market. Southwest finally soared financially when it introduced “the more efficient 737-500” aircraft that allowed it to drop its fares substantially. This technological advantage combined with its unique business model to disrupt the market by creating a new “productivity frontier” other airlines could not match without essentially becoming Southwest.

“Central to successful Disruption is creating a fundamentally new productivity frontier, one that is profitable serving segments that are unattractive to incumbents.”
How Does Disruption Work?

Disruption works when a firm moves into new markets with an innovation that demands a change the incumbents cannot afford to make. However, such a “foothold market” does not necessarily translate into disruption: An innovation could capture a niche market that stabilizes over time. The innovators who first introduced personal computers did not automatically disrupt the microcomputer market; specific technological advancements enabled the eventual disruption. Thus the next question is, can you apply disruption theory to see if a business can create a disruption? If your firm carves out a niche, you don’t necessarily need disruption; you can operate successfully with “traditional strategic differentiation.” In fact, most business rivalries aren’t “between a disruptor and an incumbent”; they’re between firms in the same conceptual category.

“A niche is not a foothold – and so strategic differentiation is not Disruptive innovation.”
To see the different roles of disruptors and incumbents, look at two successful market entrants who did not use disruption. When Holiday Inn launched in 1952, it filled a gap in the US hotel market: inexpensive, family-friendly lodging. In 1961, the Four Seasons chain entered the market specializing in comparative luxury. Both chains succeeded, but neither is technically disruptive. No technology keeps other firms from entering their markets, and any company that wishes to compete can do so with traditional, sustaining innovation. Basically, a competitor can’t substitute anything for the attributes these hotels offer in their slots: They are what they are. Thus “the hotel business has been immune to disruption because the only way to have marble countertops and a city-center location is to have marble countertops and a city-center location.” Industries such as “strategy consulting” also seem immune to disruption because they depend on experienced consultants’ highly honed skills. Disruption has hit retail selling but only on a grand scale, in the form of changes to “the discount retail format in general.”

“Predictive power establishes that a theory is useful, but it does not prove that a theory is true; a true theory explains reality.”
In the end, three general principles separate real disruptors from apparent ones. First, real disruptors offer “a new business model that defines a different frontier.” Second, usually even when a company defines a “new frontier,” it isn’t doing anything disruptive, since that would call for some new “technology or set of processes” to set it apart. Third, to force their new frontiers to grow, disruptors must offer equal or better performance at prices incumbents can’t match.

“Whether used to shape a specific project or an entire portfolio, Disruption requires a break with some very popular approaches to innovation.”
If You Want to Disrupt an Industry...

A company does not have to intend disruption to provoke it anyway. In fact, usually corporate strategists are – at least partially – unaware of their firms’ disruptive potential. However, if you wanted to disrupt an industry intentionally, could you? Most often, you couldn’t, for several reasons.

“Was Southwest (or Nucor or Maxtor or Walmart or...) Disruptive on purpose? It is a good question, and the answer is typically no.”
First, disruption often depends on a degree of luck. The right technological breakthroughs must happen just when you are positioned to take advantage of them. You must have suppliers who can produce that technology at the right time and in the correct volume and configuration to give you an edge. And you are unlikely to be an industry incumbent, because then you’re already harvesting the field’s readily available profits with existing technologies, unless, like Southwest, you employ a new technology that is disruptive.

“Disruption – the migration from a niche to mainstream markets – has also been a function of luck as much as anything else.”
If you want to disrupt a market intentionally, consider what’s required: You must target “a large, lucrative mainstream market” for disruption. That requires giving it newer, better technology that lets you compete with existing incumbents who can’t pay for the necessary “trade-off.” Finally, you must determine when your growth curve will intersect the existing market to disrupt it.

“Disruption provides an explanation of creative creation: the how, if, when and how long of the kinds of innovations that have repeatedly remade the economic landscape in the service of the general weal.”
How Should You Invest in Innovation?

Disruption theory does not explain – or claim to explain – every business success. However, investors can apply it to what they decide to spend on new companies and use it to focus their investments and spread risk throughout their portfolios. Visualize an “Innovation Portfolio Matrix,” which offers four categories of prospective investments. You can associate each option metaphorically with a game:

“The key is adopting a defining concept of strategy and innovation constraints.”
Investing in a sustaining innovation – Going with a winning market incumbent is like choosing the winner in a chess match. You know the rules; you can calculate the value and implications using known heuristics. Just as chess rivals often have evenly matched skills, these market clashes tend to occur between equal competitors. You can gain a small advantage with modest investments, but a real breakthrough requires considerable outlay. However, backing a strong incumbent brings predictable returns.
Investing in a “disruptive/entrant innovation” – This is closer to playing checkers. Players can “jump” their opponents’ pieces and force their rivals to make moves they don’t want to make. Success requires disruption – that is, an innovation that generates a new productivity frontier where you can profit but which incumbent industries can’t serve or don’t find attractive.
Investing in established firms that try to disrupt outside markets – Firms that attempt to use innovation to interrupt external markets are like bingo players: To win, you have to place and monitor a lot of bets, and you don’t know which ones, if any, will pay off.
Investing in companies that disrupt their own “existing operations” – In this tough quadrant, firms churn their own markets and displace their existing profit structures to defend themselves from impending external disruption. This requires “self-awareness regarding how much risk you are willing to tolerate and how much you are able to invest to reduce that risk. It is, in other words, a game of backgammon.”
“Disruption begins when the entrant catches up with the competition.”
Disruption theory helps investors because it disturbs only one standard business model, the “product life cycle,” which grows by following a familiar “S-shaped” curve. When a new product comes out, sales are low. Only “early adopters,” less than 15% of the market, buy it. Then it catches on, and sales grow. The “early majority” of remaining adopters makes up roughly a third of the market, and the “late majority” fills in another third. Then the growth curve flattens again, since this mature market contains only laggards.

Take personal computers: The machines that early adopters bought were not the same ones stores were selling later when most buyers came aboard. By then PCs had improved greatly; new machines replaced old ones long before the market matured enough to reach the laggards. This broadly applicable life cycle doesn’t predict how long a product will take to move through each stage. Disruption theory more accurately forecasts when a disruptive innovation will hit larger markets. Businesses “fueled by rapidly evolving technologies” will disrupt markets more quickly than companies not impelled by technological change. Disruptive firms shift from niche markets to full disruption when, due to innovation, they offer equal or higher quality than the incumbents.

How Should You Organize to Innovate?

When established firms try to innovate, they often borrow practices that work for start-up firms. They hold “idea hunts,” generate lots of concepts and fund the promising ones. And they often fail to innovate because they miss a crucial point: No matter how you apply disruption (to one idea, to a portfolio), it forces you to abandon your existing ways of thinking about innovation. Applying disruption in an incumbent industry is like trying to go back to gills after your species develops lungs. It doesn’t work.

Emerging firms often articulate their development processes in adaptive terms. They test various permutations, pick one that works and keep it, following the “variation-selection-retention model.” When venture capitalists invest in an emerging firm, they want to build a business profitable enough to sell. Their criterion is “will this make money?” In an established firm, the criteria are more complex. Such firms aren’t just economic entities; they are “political, social organisms.” Instead of evaluating ideas based only on finances, people invest their reputations and status, so incumbents are much more risk averse.

As a result, rather than variation-selection-retention, incumbents should use a “focus-shape-persist” tactic. Don’t flood your firm with new ideas; just pursue new concepts within the context of a defined, profitable future. Often ideas have been circulating in your firm, unexplored, for years. Shape them into more specific, focused possibilities.

Instead of trying to “fail fast,” try to “learn fast” and apply the lessons to your business. Instead of testing new ideas at random, articulate your model clearly so you develop innovations in a framework where they can succeed.

Thurston began by stating Disruption’s predictions. Specifically, Disruptive innovations are defined as products or services that appeal to markets or market segments that are economically unattractive to incumbents, typically because the solution is “worse” from the perspective of mainstream, profitable markets or market segments.Read more at location 463   

Disruptions typically succeed, whether launched by incumbents or entrants, but only when the ventures launching them are highly autonomous and able to design strategic planning processes and control systems and financial metrics, among other characteristics, independently of systems built for incumbent organizations.Read more at location 467   

First, a start-up typically has a trajectory of growth and profitability that is very different from that of an established business. Second, start-ups typically must change, sometimes dramatically, material elements of their strategy as they grapple with the unpredictable nature of customer reaction, competitive response, and the performance of key technologies.Read more at location 471   

Disruptors must improve in ways that allow them to compete for mainstream markets from a position of structural advantage. That is, it is not enough simply to appeal to a market or market segment that is unattractive to incumbents; that is a niche strategy.Read more at location 492   

But its original plan failed. Just as Disruption predicted. To see why, look at Image Illusions now through a Disruptive lens. First, Image Illusions was proposing a sustaining technology, targeting the largest, most important manufacturers of image-processing technology with a solution positioned as better than the alternative, the ASICs provided by its customers’ in-house designers.Read more at location 576   

Second, Intel was an entrant into this space. Compared to the depth of knowledge of incumbents in that space, the Intel managers to whom the leaders of Image Illusions reported would be likely to see the market as uncertain and Image Illusions’ initial sales as small, even if the venture was a promising growth opportunity.Read more at location 582   

In contrast, incumbents in the digital image-processing industry would defend their home markets at almost any cost. This asymmetry in motivation leaves the entrant far more likely than the incumbent to abandon the field.Read more at location 586   

even though Image Illusions was a very small investment for Intel, management time and attention are scarce resources that can rarely be allocated in proportion to the magnitude of an investment. A business that consumes 0.1 percent of the capital budget still consumes an hour at the quarterly review meeting—along with the dozens of e-mails and phone conversations and the watercooler chitchat that precede the quarterly review meeting. That is time not available to existing businesses that keep the lights on.Read more at location 605   

A proposal claiming to have a better mousetrap (sustaining innovation) and targeting a new growth opportunity for Intel (new entrant) was predicted to fail.Read more at location 619   

To bring into sharper relief the startling simplicity of Thurston’s evaluations using Disruption, recall that only three attributes of each venture were assessed: incumbent or entrant; sustaining or Disruptive; and if Disruptive, autonomous or not.

Typically, management frameworks are used to explain outcomes. Theoretical parsimony is a valuable attribute: theories that can explain complex outcomes using only a few key variables are typically the most powerful.Read more at location 785   

Since I have been part of the development of some of this additional filigree, it will not come as a surprise that I think much of this work is very helpful. But I have to accept the verdict of the data: not only do these additional dimensions not increase predictive accuracy, but they demonstrably get in the way, at least within the parameters of these experiments.Read more at location 796   

But part of Christensen’s course explores the characteristics of successful managers, and some students argued that the management of Image Illusions had had the right sorts of experiences to overcome any deficiencies in the strategic plan, leading them to predict success. Others tapped the unit’s value-chain configuration as reason for optimism, while still others felt that the strategy-formulation process was sufficiently emergent that the venture would ultimately succeed. For each business plan, students were much more likely to find something the plan did “right” in Disruption terms because they had so much more theory to work with.Read more at location 801   

Yet it turns out that these additional dimensions add no predictive power. The predictive power of Disruption seems instead to lie in its focus on the underlying strategy and technology—not the “implementation issues” surrounding planning, organizational design, and so on.Read more at location 806   

This helps explain why the students in the MIT/HBS treatment (the Disruption module) did so much better: they had much less to work with, namely, only those elements of Christensen’s course that addressed the core elements of Disruption. They did not get “distracted” by all these additional—even if very powerful—explanatory dimensions. Similarly, the Ivey treatment (the lecture alone) consisted of the most bare-bones instruction of all, and the students had no time to get distracted or forget what they had learned.Read more at location 808   

In contrast, I make a more limited and modest claim: that Disruption can deliver statistically significant and practically material improvement in your ability to innovate successfully. It is not a guarantee of success. Rather, Disruption offers nothing more—or less—than an evidence-based hope of being better at creating or picking winners than you would be otherwise.Read more at location 826

Recall from chapter 1 that central to a successful Disruption is the ability to improve in ways that enable growth, typically by competing successfully for more mainstream markets that incumbents value, without sacrificing the advantages that made success possible in the foothold markets that incumbents were relatively willing to cede.Read more at location 904   

According to the Disruption canon, a new entrant designs a business model tailored to the needs of customers that are economically unattractive to powerful incumbents.Read more at location 910   

Success in this relatively competitively isolated market constitutes the entrant’s foothold. As the entrant refines its offering and then improves it over time, it is eventually able to compete for established markets in ways incumbents cannot match—the upmarket march. The process of Disruption has typically been captured in what has become known as the “SAM” (surface-to-air missile) chart of Disruption.Read more at location 911

At , incumbents are focusing on the needs of those customers that provide the combination of volume and margin that maximizes their returns. The rational pursuit of profit maximization leads them to “overshoot” the needs of the less demanding and less economically attractive lower end of the market—or, alternatively, to ignore other smaller, new markets that offer lower returns in spite of higher margins. This overshoot of low-end markets, or ignorance of new markets, is what allows new entrants to find their foothold at . Success in the foothold market demands a business model that is different from that employed by the incumbents, one that is designd to meet primarily the needs of these markets or market segments. Incumbents do not respond because they have bigger fish to fry in their mainstream markets and are motivated to pursue still more lucrative segments farther upmarket. The “inability” of incumbents to defend against entrants’ incursions and their establishment of a foothold is not a function of organizational incompetence but rather of sound economic reasoning: why give up a dollar to defend a dime?Read more at location 916   

In other words, Southwest had found its foothold with the LCC model, and in so doing had created relatively little heartburn for the much larger incumbent airlines.Read more at location 932   

What Southwest was able to do, however, was execute the “upmarket march” ( in the diagram). In general terms, this takes the form of the entrant improving its offerings in ways that matter to the mainstream customers without sacrificing the advantages that made it profitable in its foothold. This part of the definition is crucial: if the entrant competed for the mainstream markets by adopting a business model similar to the incumbents’, all we would get is another combatant in a messy bar fight. In such battles, incumbents typically prevail. But Disruptive entrants are fundamentally different. The solutions that establish their footholds prove able to improve and bring to market better offerings, yet preserve the cost or other advantages that drove success in the relatively unattractive (to incumbents) foothold markets. This leads to : the entrant has improved enough to compete for mainstream markets, yet has preserved enough of its foothold advantages to displace the incumbent firms. For Southwest this meant the ability to fly to more and more cities and to appeal to more and more customers over time without compromising the defining elements of the LCC model.Read more at location 933

Instead, some argue that the ability to innovate—to keep pushing out the frontier and to have your competition constantly playing catch-up—is the key to sustained outperformance.Read more at location 1052

Disruptors do not merely pick a different spot on the frontier of an existing business model. Instead, they create a new business model with an entirely different frontier.Read more at location 1059   

Take the personal computer (PC) as an example. Beginning as a toy targeted at hobbyists, improvements in component technology allowed PCs to get good enough to perform tasks that had previously been the sole domain of minicomputers, yet do so at costs that were orders of magnitude less. Consequently, when PC makers got their start, they were not choosing a different spot on the frontier defined by the dominant business model in the minicomputer industry. In other words, they did not merely have a different strategy but had instead created an entirely new business model with its own, very different frontier. Consequently, those early PCs were not just worse than minicomputers, they were worse than minicomputers could possibly be, and at prices that minicomputers could never match.Read more at location 1060   

In The Innovator’s Solution, Clayton Christensen and I identified two types of Disruption, based on the different trajectories of improvement they follow.16 In the PC example above we see “low end” Disruption, so called because the initial market segment targeted by the eventual Disruptor settles for seemingly worse performance in exchange for materially lower costs. “New market” Disruption is a mirror image of this: an eventual Disruptor may well be charging significant sums for a solution, but it offers a very different bundle of nonprice value compared to incumbent solutions. Over time, this frontier is expanded thanks to cost reductions that do not undermine the performance features.Read more at location 1079   

Changing a business model, thanks largely to the organizational change this typically implies, is crushingly difficult. Disruptive growth does not require much change for the Disruptor. Disruptors build a business model that is successful in the foothold market but then are able to ride upmarket on improvements in the key technologies that determine their product or service’s performance and cost profile.Read more at location 1119   

Whatever change is required for a Disruptor to march upmarket is nothing compared to what incumbents are required to take on when attempting to turn and face a Disruptive challenge.Read more at location 1122   

This is why incumbents, however well managed or successful, typically cannot fend off genuinely Disruptive attackers. The Disruptor has fundamentally changed the game, and by the time the incumbent realizes this, it no longer has the time needed to learn the new rules or master the new skills.Read more at location 1130   

The introduction of the more efficient 737-500 was just what Southwest needed to turn everything around. With a range 53 percent greater than the 737-200—at 4,449 kilometers, it could go anywhere in the continental United States—Southwest could now fly just about anywhere it wanted to. And with a direct operating cost per revenue passenger kilometer (DOC/RPK) within 0.5¢ of the other 7-series Boeing jets, Airbus 320s, and MD-11s flown by competitors, Southwest was no longer giving back its other cost efficiencies when it flew longer routes.19 Southwest quickly incorporated the new plane into its fleet and exploited its greater range and lower costs to begin adding more routes of greater average length.Read more at location 1197   

In short, the 737-500 was to Southwest what better microprocessors were to PC makers: the key technology that made it possible for a company to improve its offerings without having to change its business model.Read more at location 1211   

however, is the sharp decline in share price: capital markets have a tendency to overshoot on both good news and bad, and lacking any clear sense of when Southwest’s highly profitable growth opportunities would run out, the company’s growth for the prior decade had been extrapolated too far into the future.Read more at location 1236   

Yet established airlines have found it very difficult to imitate Southwest’s business model—although not for lack of trying.Read more at location 1245   

With six attempts by four airlines over thirteen years—during which time Southwest’s revenue almost tripled—one cannot help but think that the consistent failure of the “airline within an airline” approach speaks to an underlying weakness in the strategy more than any putative lack of operational competence.Read more at location 1249   

What did change was a critical underlying technology that allowed Southwest’s productivity frontier to expand at a rate and in a way that enabled Southwest to Disrupt incumbent H&S air carriers. The connections among the adoption of the 737-500 by Southwest, the change in the company’s route structure, and sustained improvements in performance are precisely the kind of “smoking gun” evidence required to establish Disruption’s superior explanatory power.Read more at location 1265   

Companies capture a foothold by defining a new productivity frontier that reaches far into markets (new-market Disruption) or market segments (low-end Disruption) that are beyond the reach of the incumbents’ frontier and so are economically unattractive to them.Read more at location 1289   

The relative pace and shape of the expansion of a would-be Disruptor’s frontier determines whether there is an upmarket march, and hence a Disruption, to be had. If the new frontier defined by an entrant (like Southwest) expands in ways that break the trade-offs that define the incumbents’ frontier, then the entrant can compete for the incumbents’ mainstream markets from a position of structural advantage.Read more at location 1295   

The result, launched in 1952, was Holiday Inn, and its success is attributable to classic, well-executed strategic differentiation. Prices were kept low by keeping the facilities clean and comfortable but basic, with no indoor parking, no bellman, no room service, no concierge, and no special requests.Read more at location 1325   

Holiday Inn and Four Seasons were successful because each identified specific customer groups with specific needs and were willing to accept the trade-offs required to serve them well.Read more at location 1343   

Unwavering and consistent focus is what kept each of these companies on top of their respective—and very different—games.Read more at location 1349   

Rather, what Holiday Inn discovered was that the luxury segment had needs that could only be met with a higher-cost business model: superior furnishings and linens, more and better-trained staff, round-the-clock fine food service, and so forth. In other words, the hotel business resists Disruption because there is no enabling technology that allows a business model intended for segments unattractive to powerful incumbents to improve in ways that break the trade-offs that define the frontier of the incumbents’ business model.Read more at location 1360   

Critically, however, there remains no “enabling technology” that might allow a competitor to improve such an offering within the constraints of that model: so far, at least, the only way to provide more space is to provide more space.Read more at location 1371   

To put that in plainer language, the only way to have a concierge is to hire a concierge, and the only way to have a better concierge is to hire a better concierge. Typically, incumbents do that better than entrants. Consequently, Crowne Plaza is a solid competitor in a challenging industry, but it is not a Disruptor.Read more at location 1373   

The business of strategy consulting also seems to be resistant to Disruptive forces. The history of competition in the industry reads very much like the hotel business: a succession of small players focusing on a specific niche growing into mainstream competitors largely by replicating the business models of the successful incumbents.Read more at location 1386   

Other firms have tended to get their starts, and then grow, in much the same way. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) began by differentiating itself based on its unique expertise with the experience curve concept. This allowed it to tackle efficiently and profitably smaller engagements than were attractive to McKinsey—a form of low-end start. Yet as BCG grew and began to take on an ever-wider array of general management problems, it ended up essentially replicating McKinsey’s business model. As a result, BCG became a credible competitor but was not a Disruptor. Monitor Group’s story is very similar: from a beginning built around the application of Michael Porter’s Five Forces framework, Monitor’s subsequent success has led it to build the capabilities required to tackle an ever-wider array of general management problems—and it does so in fundamentally the same way as just about every other strategy consulting firm.Read more at location 1394   

The hotel business has been immune to Disruption because the only way to have marble countertops and a city-center location is to have marble countertops and a city center location.

In short, new entrants do not create a different business model that describes a new productivity frontier. Instead, they embrace a different set of trade-offs—at least at first—in order to find a niche of the market that they can serve profitably and that incumbents are relatively uninterested in.Read more at location 1409   

Fundamentally, then, Disruption is only possible when there is an enabling technology or process that allows one business model with a given frontier to break the trade-offs that define the frontier of a different business model that serves more attractive markets or market segments.Read more at location 1413   

For the PC makers, it was the evolution of the microprocessor, disk drives, and software, among other components, that propelled them upmarket. For Southwest, it was the increased efficiency of the Boeing 737-500 that enabled its Disruption. Still other Disruptors, such as Toyota (see below), have relied on process improvements. But in hotels and strategy consulting, to name only two examples, there is no such enabling technology that allows a fundamentally different business model to compete for mainstream segments from a position of structural advantage.Read more at location 1414   

but these inspiring leaders are rarely the fuel of Disruptive growth. Rather, the successful discount retailers that grew Disruptively did so because they used their early success as a platform for investing in, among other capabilities, highly differentiated, hard-to-replicate logistics-management processes.Read more at location 1432

Dollar General remained strongly focused on low-income households: over 40 percent of the stores’ customers came from households with less than $30,000 per year in total income.Read more at location 1455   

This approach left Dollar General able not only to serve very low-income households and to operate profitably but also to operate in very small towns: a community of twenty thousand would be ample for a Dollar General location, whereas large, successful discounters have come to require a small city of at least fifty thousand before considering opening a new location.Read more at location 1463   

But did it have an enabling technology that allowed it to pursue a truly Disruptive upmarket march? Could it break the trade-offs that defined the frontier for discount retailers or department stores?Read more at location 1473   

Combined, these two trends meant that the percentage of U.S. households that had shopped at some type of dollar store rose from 55 percent in 2000 to 67 percent in 2005.Read more at location 1478   

In other words, much of Dollar General’s growth can more reasonably be attributed to shifts in the market than to a significant expansion in the company’s productivity frontier, that is, to innovation.Read more at location 1480   

As a matter of fact (rather than theoretical necessity), the closeout retail frontier had no enabling technology that would have allowed Dollar General to grow beyond this original market segment, and so the company has had to “jump” to a new frontier and now employs a strategy that more nearly reflects the traditional discount retail model.Read more at location 1511   

Consequently, just as Dollar General has driven its growth by hopping from its distinctive frontier to that of the incumbents, generic drug makers that enter the drug discovery business are not Disruptors but merely trading one frontier for anotherRead more at location 1528   

First, the alleged Disruptor must have a new business model that defines a different frontier.Read more at location 1532   

But a niche is not a foothold—and so strategic differentiation is not Disruptive innovation.Read more at location 1536   

Disruption demands that the business model that defines this new frontier be pushed outward by a technology or set of processes that incumbents are at a disadvantage in adopting. In the case of Southwest, it was the 737-500 that pushed its frontier outward, allowing the company to compete for more and longer routes in ways that incumbent airlines could not match.Read more at location 1538   

Third and finally, successful Disruptions culminate with the new frontier expanding enough that it allows Disruptors to deliver levels of nonprice value at a cost that incumbents simply cannot match.Read more at location 1547

Companies that do not define a new business model can be expected to succeed thanks to classic strategic differentiation, that is, finding unoccupied but valuable real estate on an industry’s existing productivity frontier. This is the Holiday Inn story. A company that defines a new business model but lacks an enabling technology will likely do better because it is reaching into a segment that is fundamentally out of reach for incumbents—its degree of strategic differentiation is much greater because it has defined an entirely new frontier. It is a strategic innovator: it has found an entirely new strategy, which serves to insulate it that much more effectively from competitive pressures. This is the Dollar General story. Finally, we have bona fide Disruption when a new frontier is propelled outward by a key enabling technology, one that eventually permits our new entrant to compete for mainstream markets from a position of structural advantage without having to change its business model. That is the Walmart and Southwest story.Read more at location 1578   

True Disruptors are Disruptors by virtue of having defined a new frontier that has an enabling technology that drives the upmarket march. Dollar General defined a new frontier for extreme value retailing with its new business model but lacked the fuel that powers true Disruption; it was a “strategic differentiator”: it created a new productivity frontier thanks to its mastery of a new business model, but it is no Disruptor.Read more at location 1593

The result was a formal expression of the old commercial for Faberge Organic Shampoo: an early adopter tells two friends, and they tell two friends, and so on, and so on … and assuming enough time passes and the friends have the requisite level of innovativeness, one will observe precisely the kind of sigmoidal growth one had hoped to explain.Read more at location 1642

Similarly, as the software that drove PC performance got better—easier to use, more reliable, with a wider range of applications—large-scale consumer markets for PCs were created, and the PC began to displace other forms of recreation.

When an innovator has a business model enabled by a technology that has a well-understood trajectory of improvement, it becomes possible to make plausible estimates of when a given Disruptor will turn the corner from a profitable foothold into full-scale Disruptive growth.Read more at location 1726   

An ultimately Disruptive entrant creates a new business model that allows it to reach combinations of price and nonprice value that incumbents cannot match and that most customers do not value. The frontier of that business model is driven outward thanks to an enabling technology that allows the Disruptor to surpass the incumbents’ ability to serve increasingly demanding tiers of the market. When the Disruptor’s frontier overtakes the incumbents’ in the mainstream markets, Disruption is imminent.Read more at location 1742   

This analysis suggests a general principle: businesses with productivity frontiers fueled by rapidly evolving technology—for example, electronics—can be expected to realize their Disruptive potential far more quickly than those relying on less rapidly improving technologies—for example, mechanical technologies—while those relying primarily on process improvements will disrupt most slowly of all.Read more at location 1762   

An entrant crosses the threshold from its foothold market to fully fledged Disruption when it is finally good enough—as a consequence of the expansion of the productivity frontier of its unique business model—to do a better job for mainstream customers than solutions provided by incumbents. In other words, Disruption begins when the entrant catches up with the competition.Read more at location 1767   

Knowing that something will end is very different from knowing how long it will last before it does. And seeing the end coming can be enormously helpful for both investors and managers. Investors want to know when to shift their expectations for a company from “growth stock” to “value stock” (that is, from wealth created by share price appreciation to wealth garnered from dividends), and managers are trying to decide when to shift their emphasis from exploiting the existing growth engine to finding the next one.Read more at location 1773   

This is why I introduced the notion of the Disruptor “catching the competition,” rather than simply adoption by customers, in order to understand when Disruptive growth will begin.Read more at location 1782   

Better performance at some point simply confuses us: we can no longer adapt our lives to the useful exploitation of more-better-faster, so we become fundamentally indifferent to what used to excite us, accepting “better” only when that implies “cheaper.” This is, in the argot of established Disruption theory, “overshooting” the market. That is, providing more performance than mainstream customers are willing to pay for.Read more at location 1795   

is here that Disruption theory takes on a surface similarity with the product life cycle model. For just as growth explodes for a Disruptor as it bests the incumbents, growth slows when the Disruptor exceeds the performance requirements of mainstream customers. But now the sigmoidal growth curve that is so often observed in product markets is explained by a normal distribution of customer “demanding-ness”: small numbers of undemanding customers in the foothold market, large numbers of more demanding customers in the mainstream resulting in explosive growth, and small numbers of very demanding customers at the high end. What drives this decline in growth rate, however, is not market saturation as much as a mismatch between the rate of product performance improvement and the ability of customers to make use of those improvements.Read more at location 1798   

The first microprocessors Intel offered to the market were, by today’s standards, very low power. They were not good enough for the mainstream markets of the day: the mainframe and minicomputer makers. As a result, Intel had to settle for a foothold in the relatively undemanding market populated by cheap handheld calculators. Intel’s first volume customer for its processors was Busicom, a manufacturer of simple four-function calculators.Read more at location 1806   

For Intel to grow its business, it needed to find ways to appeal to ever-more-demanding customers. This meant improving the processor speed (megahertz) and power (number of transistors) of its chips. Such improvements were enormously difficult to deliver, and the engineering challenges were often seen as nearly insuperable. But the incentive to find a way was extremely powerful: more profitable and more rapid growth.Read more at location 1810   

The challenge, of course, is to predict when this trajectory will overshoot the willingness of consumers to pay for still more improvements.Read more at location 1820   

Consequently, when new generations of chips begin to suffer price declines soon after their introduction, we can conclude that a given trajectory has “overshot” the demands of mainstream markets.Read more at location 1823   

This signals that by the early 2000s, Intel’s trajectory of ever-greater speed and power had overshot the needs of the mainstream market. High initial prices for new generations of chips were paid only by a very few, very demanding customers at the high end of the market.Read more at location 1835   

Less demanding customers—by now the majority of total customers—were quite happy to use faster chips; they just were not willing to pay much more for them than they were paying for the chips they were already using. Maturity had arrived.Read more at location 1838   

AMD had gained this lead by beginning early—in the mid-1990s—to focus on less demanding tiers of the market where chips that were less powerful than the best that Intel had to offer were welcomed with open arms,Read more at location 1842   

AMD provided “good enough” performance for these less demanding segments (the constraint) while seeking to keep price down (the objective function).Read more at location 1848   

In short, Intel’s microprocessor business—which had for twenty years been an engine of Disruption in the computer business—was now subject to Disruption itself. AMD had drawn a new curve, reaching a new point in nonprice/price space, and was appealing to the low end of the microprocessor market. There was also good reason to think that AMD would be able to systematically improve the performance of those relatively low-end chips in ways that could ultimately Disrupt Intel. Certainly AMD’s early success was worrying to senior Intel management, especially Andy Grove, then CEO. Intel’s response was to establish a new unit in Israel, far away from the core operations in Santa Clara, California, to focus on building what would become the Celeron processor. Launched in 1998, Celeron quickly became the largest line of processors by revenue in Intel’s history. Based on the Pentium “chassis,” the Celeron was a deliberate attempt to fight back with a lower-cost, lower-priced, lower-performance microprocessor in order to defend Intel from nascent Disruptive attacks.Read more at location 1851   

Consequently, the Celeron was launched not as a better-performing, higher-priced chip but as a “good enough” chip with an introductory price only marginally higher than the prices at which previous generations of chips had been removed from the market.Read more at location 1859   

Launching an effective “counter-Disruption” on your own business is a rare and remarkable feat. It not only requires strategic insight and a powerful ability to implement thoroughgoing organizational change, it also has to be structurally possible.Read more at location 1867   

In sum, then, a given Disruptive trajectory lasts until one has overshot the performance requirements of the market one is Disrupting. This can be predicted typically in one of two ways.Read more at location 1875   

First, watch for strong downward pricing pressure due to customer resistance rather than competitive incursions; when customers want for free what they used to pay for gladly, chances are you are providing too much of a good thing. Second, look for structural limits to the level of performance a business model can provide: the enabling technology might permit still greater levels of performance, but this fuels Disruptive growth only so long as the rest of the business model need not change in order to exploit new opportunities. When either of these constraints becomes binding, Disruptive growth is at an end.Read more at location 1876   

Was Southwest [or Nucor or Maxtor or Walmart or …] Disruptive on purpose?” It is a good question, and the answer is typically no. Most companies that end up Disrupting powerful incumbents start out focused primarily, and often exclusively, on connecting with a specific segment of the market—one that is poorly served by incumbents.Read more at location 1889   

Consequently, they are looking only for some relatively uncontested market where their disadvantages compared to incumbents do not matter much and are perhaps even a benefit of some sort.Read more at location 1893

Identify a large, lucrative mainstream market you want to Disrupt. Identify what trade-offs you need to break in order to steal that market from the successful incumbents that currently dominate it. Identify a market segment of relatively little interest to any dominant incumbents that values a different set of trade-offs among the same dimensions of performance. Build a business model that serves those customers profitably and well. Be sure that business model is enabled by a rapidly improving technology that will ultimately allow you to compete for the mainstream markets you want to disrupt from a position of structural advantage by breaking the trade-offs you originally identified. Map the rate of change in the incumbents’ productivity frontier, your productivity frontier, and changing customer requirements so that you can determine the appropriate timetable for investment.Read more at location 1929

Angioplasty has been Disruptive because of the way it evolved in the marketplace. The very first angioplasty procedures were performed on extraordinarily sick patients, people so ill and fragile that the trauma of CABG surgery posed unacceptable risks. From these very early-stage applications the procedure was improved to the point that it was good enough for more general applications. At first, however, compared to CABG the procedure could address only relatively low levels of blockage in relatively easy-to-access arteries. It had the advantage in some of these cases, however, of being less risky and less expensive—essentially reaching a point in price/nonprice value space that CABG could not and that cardiac surgeons, who performed the CABG procedures, had little interest in addressing: they were busy enough with the patients they had. The frontier of angioplasty expanded as a consequence of a number of innovations.Read more at location 1976   

Cordis rode that wave of Disruption. Revenues from stents in 1996 were $790 million and peaked in 2006 at just over $4 billion.

Instead, the SEDASYS™ team explicitly developed a Disruptive strategy and targeted procedures where APs, and hence propofol, had essentially no presence: gastrointestinal (GI) procedures such as colonoscopies, or lower-GI endoscopy, and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), or upper-GI endoscopy.Read more at location 2060

For those who were using APs, the explicit performance target would now be “as good as the AP but more affordable.” In other words, for those segments SEDASYS™ would have to break the price/performance trade-off all at once. This would be like Southwest trying to compete for the New York—Los Angeles route with a 737-200.Read more at location 2097

A unit with a two- or three-year revenue plan that included material contributions from SEDASYS™ would now be faced with a painful trade-off: push ahead with targeting the full population of GI physicians and hope that the merits of SEDASYS™ would carry the day, or take on difficult discussions with more senior management to change those projections—which would, of course, have ripple effects as budgets were rolled up.Read more at location 2115   

However, because of J&J’s bias against decentralization and autonomy, and a general awareness in the senior management ranks of the power of Disruption, Karen Licitra was able quickly to secure broad-based and high-level support for the change in course. SEDASYS™ was relieved of the traditional financial and strategic planning constraints, and Gustafson and his team were free to adapt in ways that kept them on a Disruptive path. And so SEDASYS™ is going to market with a focus on nonconsumption (GI physicians not using AP-administered propofol) as its foothold.Read more at location 2122

In other words, SEDASYS™ can reach a lower cost point for relatively lower levels of performance but cannot today at any cost reach performance levels that incumbent solutions can. In short, SEDASYS™ defines a new frontier, rather than simply staking out a different point on the same frontier.Read more at location 2136   

By targeting GI physicians who do not use propofol, SEDASYS™ passes a critical test for an eventual Disruptor: it is focused on a foothold market where the competition is still predominantly nonconsumption. For these clinicians, SEDASYS™ offers a clear step up in performance at typically lower cost. Thanks to the new productivity frontier the SEDASYS™ technology has defined, APs are unlikely to be able to compete against SEDASYS™ in this segment of the GI market. This has gotten us to Dollar General territory: a strategic innovator. This is a strong position to create, and typically a highly successful one. The key question now, however, is whether SEDASYS™ will be a true Disruptor: will its productivity frontier expand in a way and at a rate that allows it to replace anesthesia professionals in an increasing number of procedures?Read more at location 2141

Since most physicians are trained and credentialed in the administration of hypnotics and analgesics, the automation of the delivery of moderate sedation through SEDASYS™ vastly increases the range of procedures that could be performed without an AP present.Read more at location 2220   

Laparoscopic methods are increasingly the standard of care for many procedures. There is growing interest and scientific evidence to suggest these less invasive approaches may not require deep levels of sedation or general anesthesia in order to be performed safely and effectively.Read more at location 2224   

Much like the expansion of the SEDASYS™ frontier thanks to an expanding label and new drugs, this dramatic shift in access to and affordability of a large number of surgical proceduresRead more at location 2228   

Putting it all together, the productivity frontier for SEDASYS™ is highly likely to expand along both the price and nonprice dimensions of performance. Its price will certainly come down as electronics decrease in price and as SEDASYS™ is manufactured at scale for a global market. Its ability to provide the level of sedation required for an increasing range of procedures will all but certainly increase thanks to advances in patient-physiology monitoring, an expanded label, the development of new hypnotics and local analgesics, renewed research interest in multimodal approaches to pain management, and the trend toward less invasive surgeries. Note especially that these trends reinforce one another, but none is dependent upon any of the others; that is, if they all happen, the impacts are synergistic, but any one of them can happen individually and still materially expand the frontier of the SEDASYS™ device. In contrast, the productivity frontier for APs is likely to expand only slowly.Read more at location 2232   

As of late 2010, SEDASYS™ had not yet secured FDA approval. But it has been approved for use in other jurisdictions, for example, the European Union and Canada. With these market footholds, and given how well SEDASYS™ fares against the tests for Disruption, it would be cowardly not to make an unequivocal prediction of Disruptive success for this innovation.Read more at location 2255

But it was not a Disruption: it appealed to the same customers and contexts of use that record stores were contesting, and the iTunes store did it with better selection (200,000 items on day one!), more convenience (online), equal sound quality, and a more appealing price, thanks to unbundling the album and using a uniform pricing structure (which has been modified only slightly since). This was “more for less” in the eyes of customers and has none of the hallmarks of either the low-end or new-market footholds that incumbents have relatively little motivation to defend. To be sure, the iPod/iTunes combination was a very different business model, but it delivered better performance targeted at exactly the same markets that incumbents coveted. That is not Disruption; that is walking into a crowded bar, picking a fight with the biggest guy there, and knocking him over with one punch.Read more at location 2307   

It is certainly the case that the increasing functionality of smartphones is a possible Disruption to personal computers, but that is not entirely relevant here. The smartphone market itself was well established, and the key performance dimensions that would drive growth were well understood by both participants and observers. Apple’s entry was not built on an insight that incumbents were strategically precluded from adopting or a focus on customers or uses that incumbents had no interest in defending. Instead, Apple had once again marched into a bar, picked a fight with another set of town tough guys (Nokia and RIM), and has, in the eyes of many, become the one to beat.Read more at location 2320   

Only Apple’s iPad seems to be a true Disruptor. The “tablet PC” market has been around for a while, with tentative exploratory steps by a variety of major PC manufacturers. But unlike the portable-music business, there has been no clear incumbent, no obvious functionality that customers value, and no clearly dominant business model. There has been no “bar” for Apple to mosey on into, no town strongman to pick a fight with. In this new market, Apple’s success has been built on its ability to connect with customers in ways many companies can only envy. Apple has therefore created a sizable and profitable niche for the iPad. Since this product’s capabilities can be expected to improve dramatically and rapidly thanks to the electronic technologies that power it, the iPad’s frontier will almost certainly expand in ways that will likely marginalize and perhaps eventually replace the personal portable computer. That is textbook Disruption.Read more at location 2329   

In each of these counterexamples (Apple and the iPod, iTunes, and iPhone; Microsoft and the Xbox) Disruption fails not only as a predictive tool but also as a compelling explanation for the outcomes. Other theories are more suitable. Intriguingly, the notion of “platform mediated networks” (PMNs) has a strong claim on laying bare the underlying causal mechanisms.34 In each case, a key driver of success seems to have been a superior ability to connect two sides to a transaction using a superior platform: the iPod/iTunes combination connected recording artists with their fans; the iPhone connected application developers with users; and Xbox connected game developers with gamers. Christensen discovered Disruption by studying how entrant companies toppled powerful incumbents; it could be that PMN is a second way for this to happen. As researchers in this space explore the explanatory power of this framework, define the circumstances of its application, and demonstrate its predictive power in those circumstances, the arsenal of empirically validated theories will expand accordingly.Read more at location 2356   

Disruption materially improves predictive power and has compelling explanatory power. But it is not a theory of everything, as these cases illustrate.

Consequently, key to victory is forcing opponents to take your pieces—something that in the short run appears in their interest—in a way that ultimately undermines their strategic position. Similarly with Disruptions: what allows entrants to march upmarket is the relative inability of incumbents to mount an effective counterattack in the early stages of a Disruptive incursion, thanks to the superior economic attractiveness of continuing to serve mainstream customers with sustaining innovations. It is by targeting unattractive market segments that Disruptors are able to exploit this difference in economic attractiveness, essentially compelling incumbents to act in ways that are contrary to their longer-run interests. A clear understanding of their business model and the improvement trajectory of the technology that drives outward the frontier defined by that business model allows entrants pursuing a Disruptive strategy to assess what their chances for survival are with better accuracy than entrants with a sustaining approach.Read more at location 2406   

Central to successful Disruption is creating a fundamentally new productivity frontier, one that is profitable serving segments that are unattractive to incumbents. An empirical fact (but not a theoretical necessity) is that the business models required to serve these segments can typically be developed and launched with relatively little investment, at least when compared to the cost of sustaining innovations in general, and certainly when compared to breakthrough sustaining innovations. The catalogue of successful Disruptors is populated almost exclusively by small, near-start-up companies that had limitedRead more at location 2414   

investment capital and had to turn a profit quickly in order to stay afloat. Consequently, Disruptive innovations can often be launched with relatively little up-front investment, even though the long-run growth and value creation is often enormous. Although the time it takes to realize these rewards varies, at least Disruptions, properly understood, have a relatively predictable time horizon, since it is predicated on the evolution of key technologies, which very often can be estimated with reasonable accuracy.Read more at location 2418   

An innovation team pursuing Disruption requires a much higher degree of functional completeness than a sustaining/incumbent team. Since Disruption requires a completely new business model—in order to create a new frontier—enabled, typically, by entirely different technologies appealing to completely new customer segments, it is not uncommon for a Disruptive entrant to be a stand-alone business (even if owned by a larger corporation).Read more at location 2422   

But in such cases the key is to “borrow” those resources, not “share” them:Read more at location 2430

gravitational pull of larger and, in the short run, more lucrative opportunities is simply too strong.Read more at location 2431   

One implication of this functional completeness and organizational autonomy is that communication between the innovation team and the mainstream organization is not a priority. Launching a Disruptive attack on a new market is fundamentally a portfolio play, a way to create new growth opportunities through intelligent diversification.Read more at location 2433   

A sustaining entrant, after all, is attempting to break trade-offs that define competition for successful incumbents, something they, too, are working toward. Will consumers like your “new and improved” version?Read more at location 2447   

How long will it take to convince them to make the switch? How vigorously and successfully will your competition respond?Read more at location 2449   

In contrast, it would appear that the Xbox division at Microsoft—also a successful entrant with a sustaining strategy—was very nearly functionally complete and was largely separate from the group responsible for developing the next generation of the Windows operating system. This made good sense, given the largely separate technological hurdles each was seeking to overcome and the relatively low level of synergy, in the short run at least, between the two divisions.Read more at location 2456   

The absence of a clear pattern in how best to manage sustaining attacks by an entrant is hardly surprising, given the low probability of success in this quadrant. It is essentially uncharted territory: success is unlikely, investment demands are high, the time horizon is uncertain, and there are few proven rules governing how to manage it.Read more at location 2459   

sustaining innovation in your core markets means improving the performance of your existing business; entering new markets, whether viaRead more at location 2464   

sustaining or Disruptive strategies, is about creating new growth.Read more at location 2465   

For instance, Intel’s launch of the Celeron processor would not have made sense while the company was still reaping the benefits of a growing business and its would-be competitors had shown no ability or desire to launch their own Disruptive attacks. It was only after AMD and others had found their foothold—but before they had begun their upmarket march—that Intel’s self-Disruption became a strategically sound path. In other words, one hardly wants to employ a scorched-earth policy when the enemy has yet to muster its troops. Self-Disruption is perhaps best seen as a defensive measure, launched at a time when Disruption by competitors seems merely possible, since by the time it is clear that a Disruptive threat looms it is too late to respond effectively. Consequently, businesses with a mandate to Disrupt their core businesses are necessarily subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than Disruptive attacks targeted at new markets: there, one can bet on the inability of incumbents to respond effectively, and so pursue Disruptive attacks based on a clear sense of when and how Disruption will be possible.Read more at location 2469   

The probability of success of a self-Disruptive innovation can be lower than that of a Disruptive entry into a new market, thanks to the earlier stage in the relationship between a potentially Disruptive business model and the evolution of the underlying technologies that could fuel that Disruption. For example, Intel’s rear-guard self-Disruption with the Celeron was an effective response to an existing, if early-stage, competitor. Although there were important aspects of the technology to work though, the company understood the broad outline of what it was dealing with.Read more at location 2486   

There are, however, at least two types of optionlike investments: growth options and strategic options.35 Growth options create the possibility of new, profitable revenues. Strategic options create the possibility of competing in your core markets in a fundamentally different way. For instance, Xbox can be seen as having both growth option and strategic option value for Microsoft. It is a new business that is successful in its own right. And it creates a foothold in a space that is potentially a new platform for software and personal computing, which is one way of characterizing Microsoft’s core business. Indeed, the company’s persistence in fighting for a meaningful piece of the smartphone OS market can also be seen as a testament to the importance of a viable strategic option in this space.Read more at location 2497   

Apple can also be seen to be launching new businesses or potentially making acquisitions with an eye to generating a portfolio of strategic options. As of the fall of 2010, rumors were beginning to make the rounds that Apple’s $50+ billion in cash would be deployed to acquire Disney or Sony or any number of other companies in order to give it a substantial position in the entertainment industry, something some observers see as critical to expanding Apple’s dominance in consumer electronics.Read more at location 2504   

Entering new markets, whether via sustaining or Disruptive strategies, typically has significantRead more at location 2507   

growth option value but can have strategic option value as well.Read more at location 2508   

In contrast, because self-Disruptions can ultimately cannibalize a good portion of the mainstream business, they are predominantly strategic options with perhaps some growth option value should it turn out to be able to take market share or grow the market. This means that self-Disruptions have many of the characteristics of Disruptive/entrants but should be managed quite differently.Read more at location 2508   

Diminishing returns set in far sooner than most realize. Disruptive growth can happen with far greater certainty that most tend to think. And Disruptive threats can materialize far more quickly than most want to believe.Read more at location 2536   

It is certainly a defensible position that playing a little bingo (sustaining/entrant) is not an entirely bad idea, either. But the structure of this game suggests that when entering new markets with sustaining innovations one must clear a particularly high bar. The need to avoid the well-documented decision-making biases of overconfidence and optimism is especially acute: it is simply too easy to believe that you have a better mousetrap.Read more at location 2543   

But for now, the most promising paths appear to lie with, in order, sustaining innovations in your current markets, Disruptive innovations in new markets or as defensive measures, and sustaining innovations in new markets.Read more at location 2551

I have come to believe that corporations can no more do this metaphorically than early cetaceans could do it literally. Consequently, the key to achieving better results lies not in the close approximation of the venture capital ecosystem but in a fundamentally different approach to an innovation strategy.Read more at location 2577   

First comes variation: there is a steady supply of new businesses seeking capital. These would-be world beaters pitch their concepts—often accompanied by working prototypes and even a year or two of market trialRead more at location 2586   

Finally, retention takes the form of the “liquidity event”: selling most or all of the equity to the public markets,Read more at location 2594   

This works for venture capital investment boards because they get to see reasonably well-developed concepts, typically without having had to spend a dime on them. Ideas are developed, prototypes funded, and even lead customers secured by the entrepreneur at the cost of nights and weekends sacrificed, vacations foregone, and second mortgages assumed.Read more at location 2601   

Indeed, many entrepreneurial success stories attribute the insights that led to eventual victory to the lessons learned from previous bitter defeats.Read more at location 2621   

But the inevitable reality of corporations—for, as is so often the case, their greatest weakness is their greatest strength—is that they are political, social organisms, not purely economic systems.Read more at location 2624   

the long memories, the jockeying for position, decision making by consensus, and a host of other ills that result in precisely the kind of risk aversion and incrementalism that leaves them vulnerable to the start-ups they allegedly seek to imitate.Read more at location 2626   

The result? The “funnel” becomes a “tunnel,” and the only projects that ever get fed into the stage-gate process are those that are all but guaranteed to make it out the other end—which is, unfortunately, very different from guaranteed commercial success, for the politics of corporate innovation do not mandate results, merely all the necessary approvals along the way.Read more at location 2628   

And so corporations often end up importing the surface features of a variation-selection-retention model, securing much of the cost and little of the benefit.Read more at location 2637   

Corporate innovation programs need to accept that organizations cannot replicate or evenRead more at location 2638

The first step is to focus the corporation’s efforts on opportunity areas that are strategically relevant.Read more at location 2642   

Using, for example, a scenario-based planning exercise that can often be conducted in two to three weeks, it is typically possible to identify a manageable list of where the most meaningful opportunities are likeliest to lie.Read more at location 2644   

Shifting from “selecting” ideas to “shaping” them is perhaps the largest break from existing standard practice.Read more at location 2653   

After all, ideas do not come prelabeled; whether a concept is commercialized in a sustaining or Disruptive way is often a matter of strategic choice.Read more at location 2657

And so, just as an ATM cannot cope with the complexity of tasks that a bank teller can but is capable of dealing with the majority of day-to-day banking transactions, MedCentre is “good enough” for significant, if less demanding, tiers of the market.Read more at location 2684   

In other words, for all MedCentre’s benefits as a sustaining innovation, achieving a clear-cut, unambiguous breakthrough is almost always very difficult to do and tainted by deep uncertainties.Read more at location 2698   

For these retailers MedCentre could well be just what the doctor ordered. MedCentre reduces the asset burden of having a pharmacy and allows the pharmacy to be open whenever the grocery store is, thanks to the economies of scale arising from the remote counseling center. Major supermarket chains have expressed significant interest in deploying MedCentre, and certainly this market could be huge for PCAS—precisely the kind of niche that could create a large and profitable business.Read more at location 2714   

It is worth considering, however, whether this application would reward subsequent improvements in the MedCentre technology in ways that could fuel long-term and truly Disruptive growth. After all, if grocery stores and other retailers wanted to compete vigorously for the mainstream retail drugstore business, it is well within their reach to make those investments, yet for the most part they have not. Consequently, it is possible that by deploying MedCentre primarily in grocery stores the device would be used to create a “strategic innovation”—the sort of Dollar General—type solution described in chapter 4.Read more at location 2718   

Only in this case MedCentre could find itself relegated to a niche—even if a large and profitable one—not because of any limitations in its technology but because of a relative lack of customer desire for the sorts of innovations that would allow MedCentre to move beyond that initial market.Read more at location 2722   

The most attractive strategic customer is the one that will reward the kinds of innovations that allow MedCentre to realize its full Disruptive potential.Read more at location 2767   

What Disruption theory offers, when applied within a paradigm of shaping, is a way to identify and consider all the options so that whatever trajectory one chooses, it is at least chosen on purpose rather than by default.Read more at location 2770   

The “retention” model of VC-type investing is built around pruning away what fails as quickly as possible, then selling what works at the height of its value.Read more at location 2773   

In addition, VC-type investing typically plays out over a much larger number of investments than operating companies are able to make.Read more at location 2778   

In addition, it is just possible that the people who work in established corporations—rather than pursuing their own entrepreneurial opportunities—are simply more risk averse than the folks who build business plans and seek venture financing.Read more at location 2781   

In light of this, I propose an amendment to the oft-repeated mantra of “fail fast.” Instead, “learn fast” and use what you learn to improve your existing initiative in ways that avoid failure as much as possible.Read more at location 2787   

In short, whether or not something is “good” is a function of its survival as determined by a contest in which all combatants put forth their best efforts.Read more at location 2806

With this in mind, the board’s responsibility is not to worry about the specifics of an innovation. Rather, it falls to the board to make the hard choices about the level of investment an organization will make in each of the four quadrants of the IPM.Read more at location 2814   

How resources are allocated across the four types of innovation will be a key determinant of the organization’s overall innovation risk profile. A company with too much emphasis on “chess” (sustaining/incumbent) will be vulnerable to Disruptive attacks; a firm with too much wagered on “bingo” (sustaining/entrant) will be subject to the vagaries of fate; a company with too little committed to “checkers” (Disruptive/entrant) will be unable to drive long-term growth; and so on. It is the board’s job, then, to concentrate on the focus phase.Read more at location 2816   

Success is then a function of the willingness to persist in formulating and testing hypotheses and incorporating feedback quickly and efficiently in the pursuit of the specified goal.Read more at location 2835   

I hope it is that I have shown that Disruption has, for now at least, the most valid claim on describing how the creation that leads to the kind of innovation that Schumpeter described actually happens. It is not by pushing out the existing productivity frontier in a manner that is, in all likelihood, wholly replicable by one’s equally endowed competitors. Rather, it is creating an entirely new business model—a new form of organization, to use Schumpeter’s term—that makes possible what incumbents can, almost literally, not even dream of—not because it is beyond their imaginations but because it is beyond their desires.Read more at location 2865
