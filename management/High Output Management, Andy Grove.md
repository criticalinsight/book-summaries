the basics of management remain largely unaffected.Read more at location 78   

we were forced to retreat and cut prices to a level where being in the DRAM business brought us major losses. Ultimately, the losses forced us to do something extraordinarily difficult: Read more at l   Read more at location   ocation  89   

Globalization simply means that business knows no national boundaries.Read more at location 98   

Middle managers are the muscle and bone of every sizable organization,Read more at location 137   

These know-how managers are sources of knowledge, skills, and understanding to people around them in an organization. They are specialists and experts of some sort who act as consultants to other members of the organization; they are, in effect, nodes in a loosely defined network of information.Read more at location 144   

Thus a know-how manager can legitimately be called a middle manager.Read more at location 148   

What are the rules of the new environment? First, everything happens faster. Second, anything that can be done will be done, if not by you, then by someone else.Read more at location 155   

Again, as a manager in such a workplace, you need to develop a higher tolerance for disorder.Read more at location 157   

Now, you should still not accept disorder.Read more at location 158   

In fact, you should do your best to drive what’s around you to order.Read more at location 158   

“Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos.”Read more at location 165   

This book contains three basic ideas. The first is an output-oriented approach to management.Read more at location 171   

The second idea is that the work of a business, of a government bureacracy, of most forms of human activity, is something pursued not by individuals but by teams. This idea is summed up in what I regard as the single most important sentence of this book: The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.Read more at location 182   

High managerial productivity, I argue, depends largely on choosing to perform tasks that possess high leverage. A team will perform well only if peak performance is elicited from the individuals in it.Read more at location 188   

We must recognize that no amount of formal planning can anticipate changes such as globalization and the information revolution we’ve referred to above. Does that mean that you shouldn’t plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.Read more at location 192   

Second, a responsive company should have fewer levels of managers. This concept is easier to apply today as electronic mail can carry information to anyone in the organization. One basic role of management—the role of disseminating information—is no longer as important a managerial function as it was in the past. With fewer levels in today’s organization, each manager will have larger numbers of employees reporting to him than was the case ten years ago. One of the fundamental tenets of Intel’s managerial philosophy is the one-on-one meeting between a supervisor and a subordinate.Read more at location 196   

As a general rule, you have to accept that no matter where you work, you are not an employee—you are in a business with one employee: yourself. You are in competition with millions of similar businesses.Read more at location 217   

So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competitive advantage.Read more at location 222   

You must compete with millions of individuals every day, and every day you must enhance your value, hone your competitive advantage, learn, adapt, get out of the way, move from job to job, even from industry to industry if you must and retrench if you need to do so in order to start again.Read more at location 230

output of a manager is the output of his organization.Read more at location 235   

2. Are you plugged into what’s happening around you? And that includes what’s happening inside your company as well as inside your industry as a whole.Read more at location 237   

3. Are you trying new ideas, new techniques, and new technologies, and I mean personally trying them, not just reading about them?Read more at location 239   

From my own experience at Intel, I strongly believe that applying the methods of production, exercising managerial leverage, and eliciting an athlete’s desire for peak performance can help nearly everyone—lawyers, teachers, engineers, supervisors, even book editors; in short, middle managers of all kinds—to work more productively.Read more at location 247   

High Output Management opens by teaching us the importance of proper system design even when we are dealing with a system of human beings—especially when we are dealing with a system of human beings.Read more at location 281   

A manager’s output = the output of his organization + the output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.Read more at location 290   

manager’s skills and knowledge are only valuable if she uses them to get more leverage from her people.Read more at location 293   

That’s what being a manager is about. It’s not about how smart you are or how well you know your business; it’s about how that translates to the team’s performance and output.Read more at location 295   

“When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can’t do it or won’t do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.” This insight enables a manager to dramatically focus her efforts. All you can do to improve the output of an employee is motivate and train. There is nothing else.Read more at location 297   

In my experience, managers who don’t have one-on-ones understand very little about what’s happening in their organizations.Read more at location 309

By breaking down the process, he makes hard things manageable.Read more at location 322   

Specifically, it depends on the employee. If the employee is immature in the task, then hands-on training is essential. If the employee is more mature, then a delegate approach is warranted.Read more at location 328   

Finally, he reiterates his thesis that there are only two ways in which a manager can impact an employee’s output: motivation and training.Read more at location 335   

“CEOs always act on leading indicators of good news, but only act on lagging indicators of bad news.”Read more at location 357   

“In order to build anything great, you have to be an optimist, because by definition you are trying to do something that most people would consider impossible.Read more at location 358   

Optimists most certainly do not listen to leading indicators of bad news.” But this insight won’t be in any book. When I suggested he write something on the topic, his response was: “Why would I do that? It would be a waste of time to write about how to not follow human nature.Read more at location 359   
Note: this are the principles of nature Edit
It would be like trying to stop the Peter Principle.* CEOs must be optimists and all in all that’s a good thing.”Read more at location 361   

The first thing we must do is to pin down the step in the flow that will determine the overall shape of our operation, which we’ll call the limiting step. The issue here is simple: which of the breakfast components takes the longest to prepare? Because the coffee is already steaming in the kitchen and the toast takes only about a minute, the answer is obviously the egg, so we should plan the entire job around the time needed to boil it.Read more at location 390   

First you must allow time to assemble the items on a tray. Next you must get the toast from the toaster and the coffee from the pot, as well as the egg out of the boiling water. Adding the required time to do this to the time needed to get and cook the egg defines the length of the entire process—called, in production jargon, the total throughput time.Read more at location 396   

The key idea is that we construct our production flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, or most sensitive, or most expensive) step and work our way back.Read more at location 400   

Making the eggs is the limiting step.Read more at location 407   

To apply the basic principle of production, you need to build the sequence here around its most expensive feature, which is the students’ trip to the plant, thanks to the cost of travel and the time that Intel managers spend with the candidates.Read more at location 413   

Other production principles underlie the preparation of our breakfast. In the making of it, we find present the three fundamental types of production operations: process manufacturing, an activity that physically or chemically changes material just as boiling changes an egg; assembly, in which components are put together to constitute a new entity just as the egg, the toast, and the coffee together make a breakfast; and test,Read more at location 421   

The egg still determines the overall quality of the breakfast, but your time offsets must be altered.Read more at location 453   

Toaster capacity has become the limiting step, and what you do has to be reworked around it.Read more at location 457   

If you were managing the restaurant, you could turn your personnel into specialists by hiring one egg-cooker, one toast-maker, one coffee-pourer, and one person to supervise the operation. But that, of course, creates an immense amount of overhead, probably making it too expensive to consider.Read more at location 464   

But at least you know that alternatives do exist: equipment capacity, manpower, and inventory can be traded off against each other and then balanced against delivery time.Read more at location 471   

Because each alternative costs money, your task is to find the most cost-effective way to deploy your resources—the key to optimizing all types of productive work.Read more at location 472   

What is important is the thinking you force yourself to go through to understand the relationship between the various aspects of your production process.Read more at location 478   

We have now turned things into a continuous operation at the expense of flexibility, and we can no longer prepare each customer’s order exactly when and how he requests it. So our customers have to adjust their expectations if they want to enjoy the benefits of our new mode: lower cost and more predictable product quality.Read more at location 484   

The point is that whenever possible, you should choose in-process tests over those that destroy product.Read more at location 499   

To avoid such problems, you will want to look at the eggs at the time of receipt, something called incoming or receiving inspection.Read more at location 501   

To avoid that, you need a raw material inventory.Read more at location 503   

That means if your egg man comes by and delivers once a day, you want to keep a day’s worth of inventory on handRead more at location 505   

All production flows have a basic characteristic: the material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process.Read more at location 510   

college graduate to whom we are ready to extend an employment offer is more valuable to us than the college student we meet on campus for the first time.Read more at location 514   

A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.Read more at location 516   

Likewise, if we can decide that we don’t want a college candidate at the time of the campus interview rather than during the course of a plant visit, we save the cost of the trip and the time of both the candidate and the interviewers.Read more at location 518   

Everyone knows that prisons are overcrowded, and that many criminals end up serving shorter jail terms or no jail terms at all because cells are in such short supply. So a terribly expensive trade-off results, violating the most important production principles.Read more at location 533   

But to run your operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements.Read more at location 545   

Let’s say that as manager of the breakfast factory, you will work with five indicators to meet your production goals on a daily basis.Read more at location 549   

Perhaps you should set up a “customer complaint log” maintained by the cashier.Read more at location 564   

So because indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting.Read more at location 571   

This you can do by pairing indicators, so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Thus,Read more at location 572   

In sum, joint monitoring is likely to keep things in the optimum middle ground.Read more at location 576   

The first rule is that a measurement—any measurement—is better than none.Read more at location 579   

But a genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved.Read more at location 579   

Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).Read more at location 580   

The second criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing.Read more at location 581   

In fact, if indicators are put in place, the competitive spirit engendered frequently has an electrifying effect on the motivation each group brings to its work, along with a parallel improvement in performance. MoreRead more at location 600   

We can think of our breakfast factory as if it were a “black box”: input (the raw materials) and the labor of waiters, helpers, and you, the manager, flowing into the box, and the output (the breakfast) flowing out of it as illustrated below.Read more at location 603   

Similarly, the process of field sales training can be seen as a black box with the input being the raw product specifications and the output being trained sales personnel.Read more at location 607   

The labor here is the work of the marketing and merchandising people who turn raw information into usable sales tools and train the field sales personnel to exploit them.Read more at location 608   

Read more at location 613   

The black box sorts out what the inputs, the output, and the labor are in the production process. We can improve our ability to run that process byRead more at location 617   

Read more at location 620   

Leading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like.Read more at location 625   

Of course, for leading indicators to do you any good, you must believe in their validity.Read more at location 626   

Leading indicators might include the daily monitors we use to run our breakfast factory, from machine downtime records to an index of customer satisfaction—both of which can tell us if problems lie down the road.Read more at location 630   

generally applicable example of a “window” cut into the black box is the linearity indicator.Read more at location 632   

Thus, the linearity indicator flashes an early warning, allowing us time to take corrective action. Without it, we would discover that we had missed our target in June, when nothing can be done about it.Read more at location 637   

The linearity indicator will help you anticipate such a problem and is therefore quite valuable.Read more at location 648   

Also valuable are trend indicators. These show output (breakfasts delivered, software modules completed, vouchers processed) measured against time (performance this month versus performance over a series of previous months),Read more at location 649   

A display of trends forces you to look at the future as you are led to extrapolate almost automatically from the past. This extrapolation gives us another window in our black box.Read more at location 650   

Another sound way to anticipate the future is through the use of the stagger chart, which forecasts an output over the next several months.Read more at location 653   

But even more important, the improvement or deterioration of the forecasted outlook from one month to the next provides the most valuable indicator of business trends that I have ever seen.Read more at location 662

have found the “stagger chart” the best means of getting a feel for future business trends.Read more at location 669   

A furniture factory builds to order.Read more at location 676   

In short, you will have to build to forecast, which is a contemplation of future orders.Read more at location 682   

At Intel, we build to forecast because our customers demand that we respond to their needs in a timely fashion, even though our manufacturing throughput times are quite long. Our breakfast factory makes its product to customer order, but buys from its suppliers—like the egg man—on the basis of forecasted demand.Read more at location 687   

Ideally, the order for the product and the product itself should arrive on the shipping dock at the same time.Read more at location 696   

Because neither the sales flow nor the manufacturing flow is completely predictable, we should deliberately build a reasonable amount of “slack” into the system.Read more at location 710   

And inventory is the most obvious place for it.Read more at location 711   

It is a good idea to use stagger charts in both the manufacturing and sales forecasts. As noted, they will show the trend of change from one forecast to another, as well as the actual results. By repeatedly observing the variance of one forecast from another, you will continually pin down the causes of inaccuracy and improve your ability to forecast both orders and the availability of product.Read more at location 715

To get acceptable quality at the lowest cost, it is vitally important to reject defective material at a stage where its accumulated value is at the lowest possible level.Read more at location 731   
Note: in mvp these are features of a product Edit
In short, reject before investing further value.Read more at location 734   

In the language of production, the lowest-value-point inspection where we inspect raw material is called incoming material inspection or receiving inspection. If we again use a black box to represent our production process, inspections that occur at intervening points within it are called, logically enough, in-process inspections. Finally, the last possible point of inspection, when the product is ready to be shipped to the customer, is called final inspection or outgoing quality inspection.Read more at location 734   

Read more at location 739   

While in most instances the decision to accept or reject defective material at a given inspection point is an economic one, one should never let substandard material proceed when its defects could cause a complete failure—a reliability problem—for our customer.Read more at location 748   

If some of the components don’t work upon receipt by the manufacturer, he can replace them while the unit is still in the factory. This will probably increase costs. But if the component fails later, after the pacemaker has been implanted, the cost of the failure is much more than a financial one.Read more at location 752   

Let’s consider a few techniques commonly used to balance the two needs. There is a gate-like inspection and a monitoring step. In the former, all material is held at the “gate” until the inspection tests are completed. If the material passes, it is moved on to the next stage in the production process; if the material fails, it will be returned to an earlier stage, where it will be reworked or scrapped.Read more at location 758   

As a rule of thumb, we should lean toward monitoring when experience shows we are not likely to encounter big problems.Read more at location 769   

Another way to lower the cost of quality assurance is to use variable inspections. Because quality levels vary over time, it is only common sense to vary how often we inspect. For instance, if for weeks we don’t find problems, it would seem logical to check less often. But if problems begin to develop, we can test ever more frequently until quality again returns to the previous high levels.Read more at location 770   

If our government wants British tourists to visit the United States, our government should not irritate these would-be visitors. And if the embassy can’t get the money to increase its staff, a simple solution can be borrowed from basic production techniques. We need, in short, to replace their present scheme with a quality assurance test.Read more at location 786   

For that, the bureaucratic minds at the embassy would need to accept that a 100 percent check of the visa applicants is unnecessary. Some 98 percent of those applying are approved without any question. So if the embassy were to institute a sampling test of visas (a quality assurance test),Read more at location 789   

Later, when we examine managerial productivity, we’ll see that when a manager digs deeply into a specific activity under his jurisdiction, he’s applying the principle of variable inspection. If the manager examined everything his various subordinates did, he would be meddling, which for the most part would be a waste of his time.Read more at location 795   

The principle of variable inspection applied to managerial work nicely skirts both problems, and, as we shall see, gives us an important tool for improving managerial productivity.Read more at location 798   

We can change the nature of the work performed: what we do, not how fast we do it. We want to increase the ratio of output to activity, thereby increasing output even if the activity per employee-hour remains the same. As the slogan has it, we want to “work smarter, not harder.”Read more at location 806   

An activity with high leverage will generate a high level of output; an activity with low leverage, a low level of output.Read more at location 819   

Thus, a very important way to increase productivity is to arrange the work flow inside our black box so that it will be characterized by high output per activity, which is to say high-leverage activities.Read more at location 824   

Automation is certainly one way to improve the leverage of all types of work.Read more at location 825   

work simplification.Read more at location 827   

To get leverage this way, you first need to create a flow chart of the production process as it exists. Every single step must be shown on it; no step should be omitted in order to pretty things up on paper. Second, count the number of steps in the flow chart so that you know how many you started with. Third, set a rough target for reduction of the number of steps. In the first round of work simplification, our experience shows that you can reasonably expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction.Read more at location 828   

If he supervises a design group, his output consists of completed designs that work correctly and are ready to go into manufacturing.Read more at location 855   

manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influenceRead more at location 859   

But the key definition here is that the output of a manager is a result achieved by a group either under her supervision or under her influence.Read more at location 872   

It is important to understand that a manager will find himself engaging in an array of activities in order to affect output. As the middle managers I queried said, a manager must form opinions and make judgments, he must provide direction, he must allocate resources, he must detect mistakes, and so on. All these are necessary to achieve output. But output and activity are by no means the same thing.Read more at location 877   

Part of the problem here stems from the distinction between our activities, which is what we actually do, and our output, which is what we achieve. The latter seems important, significant, and worthwhile. The former often seems trivial, insignificant, and messy.Read more at location 898   

My day always ends when I’m tired and ready to go home, not when I’m done. I am never done. Like a housewife’s, a manager’s work is never done.Read more at location 963   

A manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift his energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of his organization. In other words, he should move to the point where his leverage will be the greatest.Read more at location 965   

I have to confess that the information most useful to me, and I suspect most useful to all managers, comes from quick, often casual verbal exchanges.Read more at location 974   

But reports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.Read more at location 978   

Beyond relaying facts, a manager must also communicate his objectives, priorities, and preferences as they bear on the way certain tasks are approached. This is extremely important, because only if the manager imparts these will his subordinates know how to make decisions themselves that will be acceptable to the manager, their supervisor.Read more at location 1005   

The third major kind of managerial activity, of course, is decision-making.Read more at location 1011   

We provide factual inputs or just offer opinions, we debate the pros and cons of alternatives and thereby force a better decision to emerge, we review decisions made or about to be made by others, encourage or discourage them, ratify or veto them.Read more at location 1013   

It’s obvious that your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager’s life.Read more at location 1019   

In short, information-gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why I choose to spend so much of my day doing it.Read more at location 1022   

Let’s call it “nudging” because through it you nudge an individual or a meeting in the direction you would like.Read more at location 1026   

In reality, for every unambiguous decision we make, we probably nudge things a dozen times.Read more at location 1029   

While we move about, doing what we regard as our jobs, we are role models for people in our organization—our subordinates,Read more at location 1030   

All managers need to act so that they can be seen exerting influence, but they should do so in their own way.Read more at location 1034   

A great deal of a manager’s work has to do with allocating resources: manpower, money, and capital. But the single most important resource that we allocate from one day to the next is our own time.Read more at location 1042   

Getting together with others is not, of course, an activity—it is a medium.Read more at location 1050   

But you must choose the most effective medium for what you want to accomplish, and that is the one that gives you the greatest leverage.Read more at location 1051   

Leverage is the measure of the output generated by any given managerial activity.Read more at location 1055   

Clearly the key to high output means being sensitive to the leverage of what you do during the day.Read more at location 1065   

Managerial productivity—that is, the output of a manager per unit of time worked—can be increased in three ways: 1.  Increasing the rate with which a manager performs his activities, speeding up his work. 2.  Increasing the leverage associated with the various managerial activities. 3.  Shifting the mix of a manager’s activities from those with lower to those with higher leverage.Read more at location 1066   

Each time a manager imparts his knowledge, skills, or values to a group, his leverage is high, as members of the group will carry what they learn to many others.Read more at location 1091   

A manager can also exert high leverage by engaging in an activity that takes him only a short time, but that affects another person’s performance over a long time. A performance review represents a good example of this.Read more at location 1101   

him for who knows how long. Another seemingly trivial piece of work—creating a tickler file—can improve daily work significantly for a long time. Setting up the simple mechanical aid is a one-time activity, yet it is likely to improve the productivity of the manager who uses it indefinitely. Thus the leverage here is very, very high.Read more at location 1105   

Examples of high negative leverage abound. After going through the annual planning process, an Intel manager saw that, in spite of successful cost reduction efforts in the prior year, his division was still not going to make any money in the coming year. The manager became depressed. Though he didn’t realize it, he almost immediately began to affect people around him and soon depression spread throughout his organization. He snapped out of it only when someone on his staff finally told him what he was doing to the people under him.Read more at location 1108   

Both the depressed and the waffling manager can have virtually unlimited negative leverage. If people are badly affected by a poor sales training effort, the situation can be handled by retraining the group. But the negative leverage produced by depression and waffling is very hard to counter because their impact on an organization is both so pervasive and so elusive.Read more at location 1114   

Managerial meddling is also an example of negative leverage. This occurs when a supervisor uses his superior knowledge and experience of a subordinate’s responsibilities to assume command of a situation rather than letting the subordinate work things through himself. For example, if a senior manager sees an indicator showing an undesirable trend and dictates to the person responsible a detailed set of actions to be taken, that is managerial meddling. In general, meddling stems from a supervisor exploiting too much superior work knowledge (real or imagined). The negative leverage produced comes from the fact that after being exposed to many such instances, the subordinate will begin to take a much more restricted view of what is expected of him, showing less initiative in solving his own problems and referring them instead to his supervisor.Read more at location 1116   

The third kind of managerial activity with high leverage is exercised by a person with unique skills and knowledge.Read more at location 1124   

The art of management lies in the capacity to select from the many activities of seemingly comparable significance the one or two or three that provide leverage well beyond the others and concentrate on them. For me, paying close attention to customer complaints constitutes a high-leverage activity.Read more at location 1133   

The “delegator” and “delegatee” must share a common information base and a common set of operational ideas or notions on how to go about solving problems,Read more at location 1141   

You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment, and monitoring the delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure a result.Read more at location 1151   

Monitoring the results of delegation resembles the monitoring used in quality assurance.Read more at location 1160   

We should apply quality assurance principles and monitor at the lowest-added-value stage of the process.Read more at location 1161   

For example, review rough drafts of reports that you have delegated; don’t wait until your subordinates have spent time polishing them into final form before you find out that you have a basic problem with the contents.Read more at location 1162   

second principle applies to the frequency with which you check your subordinates’ work. A variable approach should be employed, using different sampling schemes with various subordinates;Read more at location 1164   

To use quality assurance principles effectively, the manager should only go into details randomly, just enough to try to ensure that the subordinate is moving ahead satisfactorily. To check into all the details of a delegated task would be like quality assurance testing 100 percent of what manufacturing turned out.Read more at location 1169   

These time-management suggestions can be improved upon, I think, by applying our production principles. First, we must identify our limiting step: what is the “egg” in our work? In a manager’s life some things really have to happen on a schedule that is absolute. For me, an example is the class I teach. I know when it is going to meet, and I know I must prepare for it. There is no “give” in the time here, because over two hundred students will be expecting me. Accordingly, I have to create offsets and schedule my other work around this limiting step. In short, if we determine what is immovable and manipulate the more yielding activities around it, we can work more efficiently.Read more at location 1185   

A second production principle we can apply to managerial work is batching similar tasks.Read more at location 1190   

Similarly, if a manager has a number of reports to read or a number of performance reviews to approve, he should set aside a block of time and do a batch of them together, one after the other,Read more at location 1198   

Forecasting and planning your time around key events are literally like running an efficient factory.Read more at location 1204   

What is the medium of a manager’s forecast? It is something very simple: his calendar.Read more at location 1205   

To gain better control of his time, the manager should use his calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking a firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day.Read more at location 1207   

To use your calendar as a production-planning tool, you must accept responsibility for two things: 1.  You should move toward the active use of your calendar, taking the initiative to fill the holes between the time-critical events with non-time-critical though necessary activities. 2.  You should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.Read more at location 1215   

There is an optimum degree of loading, with enough slack built in so that one unanticipated phone call will not ruin your schedule for the rest of the day. You need some slack.Read more at location 1227   

manager should carry a raw material inventory in terms of projects.Read more at location 1229   

Without such an inventory of projects, a manager will most probably use his free time meddling in his subordinates’ work.Read more at location 1232   

This means that even as we try to standardize what we do, we should continue to think critically about what we do and the approaches we use.Read more at location 1237   

As a rule of thumb, a manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many. This range comes from a guideline that a manager should allocate about a half day per week to each of his subordinates.Read more at location 1241   

Accordingly, we should do everything we can to prevent little stops and starts in our day as well as interruptions brought on by big emergencies. Even though some of the latter are unavoidable, we should always be looking for sources of future high-priority trouble by cutting windows into the black box of our organization. Recognizing you’ve got a time bomb on your hands means you can address a problem when you want to, not after the bomb has gone off.Read more at location 1265   

The most common problem cited was uncontrolled interruptions, which in remarkably uniform fashion affected both supervisory and know-how managers.Read more at location 1273   

There are better ways. Let’s apply a production concept. Manufacturers turn out standard products. By analogy, if you can pin down what kind of interruptions you’re getting, you can prepare standard responses for those that pop up most often.Read more at location 1281   

The two basic managerial roles produce two basic kinds of meetings. In the first kind of meeting, called a process-oriented meeting, knowledge is shared and information is exchanged. Such meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. The purpose of the second kind of meeting is to solve a specific problem. Meetings of this sort, called mission-oriented, frequently produce a decision. They are ad hoc affairs, not scheduled long in advance, because they usually can’t be.Read more at location 1313   

At Intel we use three kinds of process-oriented meetings: the one-on-one, the staff meeting, and the operation review.Read more at location 1323   

How often should you have one-on-ones? Or put another way, how do you decide how often somebody needs such a meeting? The answer is the job- or task-relevant maturity of each of your subordinates. In other words, how much experience does a given subordinate have with the specific task at hand?Read more at location 1339   

I feel that a one-on-one should last an hour at a minimum.Read more at location 1351   

A key point about a one-on-one: It should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by him. There’s good reason for this. Somebody needs to prepare for the meeting. The supervisor with eight subordinates would have to prepare eight times; the subordinate only once.Read more at location 1356   

So the latter should be asked to prepare an outline, which is very important because it forces him to think through in advance all of the issues and points he plans to raise.Read more at location 1359   

The supervisor is there to learn and to coach.Read more at location 1370   

After we pondered the data for a while and considered their relationship to other indicators of business activity in our industry, we came to the reluctant conclusion that business was in fact slowing down. This meant we should take a conservative approach to near-term investment—no small matter. By sharing his base of information with me, the two of us developed a congruent attitude, approach, and conclusion: conservatism in our expansion plans.Read more at location 1407   

A staff meeting is one in which a supervisor and all of his subordinates participate, and which therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers.Read more at location 1418   

What should be discussed at a staff meeting? Anything that affects more than two of the people present. If the meeting degenerates into a conversation between two people working on a problem affecting only them, the supervisor should break it off and move on to something else that will include more of the staff, while suggesting that the two continue their exchange later.Read more at location 1430   

It should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts for the meeting.Read more at location 1434   

The figure opposite shows that the supervisor’s most important roles are being a meeting’s moderator and facilitator, and controller of its pace and thrust.Read more at location 1441   

Staff meetings are an ideal medium for decision-making, because the group of managers present has typically worked together for a long time.Read more at location 1443   

OPERATION REVIEWS This is the medium of interaction for people who don’t otherwise have much opportunity to deal with one another. The format here should include formal presentations in which managers describe their work to other managers who are not their immediate supervisors, and to peers in other parts of the company.Read more at location 1452   

As a rule of thumb, I would recommend four minutes of presentation and discussion time per visual aid, which can include tables, numbers, or graphics.Read more at location 1475   

Unlike a process-oriented meeting, which is a regularly scheduled affair held to exchange knowledge and information, the mission-oriented meeting is usually held ad hoc and is designed to produce a specific output, frequently a decision. The key to success here is what the chairman does.Read more at location 1487   

An estimate of the dollar cost of a manager’s time, including overhead, is about $100 per hour. So a meeting involving ten managers for two hours costs the company $2,000. Most expenditures of $2,000 have to be approved in advance by senior people—Read more at location 1496   

Keep in mind that a meeting called to make a specific decision is hard to keep moving if more than six or seven people attend. Eight people should be the absolute cutoff.Read more at location 1506   

The chairman should finally be responsible for logistical matters.Read more at location 1513   

He should also send out an agenda that clearly states the purpose of the meeting, as well as what role everybody there is expected to play to get the desired output.Read more at location 1514   

Once the meeting is over, the chairman must nail down exactly what happened by sending out minutes that summarize the discussion that occurred, the decision made, and the actions to be taken.Read more at location 1537   

Remember, Peter Drucker said that if people spend more than 25 percent of their time in meetings, it is a sign of malorganization. I would put it another way: the real sign of malorganization is when people spend more than 25 percent of their time in ad hoc mission-oriented meetings.Read more at location 1545   

Illustrated on this page is an ideal model of decision-making in a know-how business. The first stage should be free discussion, in which all points of view and all aspects of an issue are openly welcomed and debated.Read more at location 1571   

Read more at location 1581   

The next stage is reaching a clear decision. Again, the greater the disagreement about the issue, the more important becomes the word clear.Read more at location 1585   

Finally, everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group full support. This does not necessarily mean agreement: so long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome.Read more at location 1590   

But an organization does not live by its members agreeing with one another at all times about everything. It lives instead by people committing to support the decisions and the moves of the business.Read more at location 1594   

Another desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it.Read more at location 1604   

To make a decision, if you can’t find people with both qualities, you should aim to get the best possible mix of participants available.Read more at location 1609   

My answer was that this is not affectation but a matter of survival. In our business we have to mix knowledge-power people with position-power people daily, and together they make decisions that could affect us for years to come. If we don’t link our engineers with our managers in such a way as to get good decisions, we can’t succeed in our industry.Read more at location 1615   

The model is also hard to implement because anybody who makes a business decision also possesses emotions such as pride, ambition, fear, and insecurity.Read more at location 1619   

the peer-group syndrome manifests itself, and the meeting has no formal chairman, the person who has the most at stake should take charge. If that doesn’t work, one can always ask the senior person present to assume control.Read more at location 1647   

A related phenomenon influences lower-level people present in the meeting. This group has to overcome the fear of being overruled, which might mean embarrassment: if the rest of the group or a senior-level manager vetoed a junior person or opposed a position he was advocating, the junior manager might lose face in front of his peers. This, even more than fear of sanctions or even of the loss of job, makes junior people hang back and let the more senior people set the likely direction of decision-making.Read more at location 1655   

Sometimes no amount of discussion will produce a consensus, yet the time for a decision has clearly arrived. When this happens, the senior person (or “peer-plus-one”) who until now has guided, coached, and prodded the group along has no choice but to make a decision himself. IfRead more at location 1667   

In other words, one of the manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance: •  What decision needs to be made? •  When does it have to be made? •  Who will decide? •  Who will need to be consulted prior to making the decision? •  Who will ratify or veto the decision? •  Who will need to be informed of the decision?Read more at location 1684   

Politics and manipulation or even their appearance should be avoided at all costs.Read more at location 1727   

One last thing. If the final word has to be dramatically different from the expectations of the people who participated in the decision-making process (had I chosen, for example, to cancel the Philippine plant project altogether), make your announcement but don’t just walk away from the issue. People need time to adjust, rationalize, and in general put their heads back together. Adjourn, reconvene the meeting after people have had a chance to recover, and solicit their views of the decision at that time. This will help everybody accept and learn to live with the unexpected.Read more at location 1728

What do my customers want from me now? Am I satisfying them? What will they expect from me one year from now? You need to focus on the difference between what your environment demands from you now and what you expect it to demand from you a year from now. Such a difference analysis is crucial,Read more at location 1772   

Should you at this stage consider what practical steps you can actually take to handle matters? No, that will just confuse the issue.Read more at location 1776   

STEP 2—PRESENT STATUS The second step of planning is to determine your present status.Read more at location 1781   

STEP 3—WHAT TO DO TO CLOSE THE GAP The final step of planning consists of undertaking new tasks or modifying old ones to close the gap between your environmental demand and what your present activities will yield.Read more at location 1789   

The first question is, What do you need to do to close the gap? The second is, What can you do to close the gap? Consider each question separately, and then decide what you actually will do, evaluating what effect your actions will have on narrowing the gap, and when. The set of actions you decide upon is your strategy.Read more at location 1791   

Much confusion exists between what is strategy and what is tactics. Although the distinction is rarely of practical significance, here’s one that might be useful. As you formulate in words what you plan to do, the most abstract and general summary of those actions meaningful to you is your strategy. What you’ll do to implement the strategy is your tactics. Frequently, a strategy at one managerial level is the tactical concern of the next higher level.Read more at location 1793   

Cindy then defined her strategy—her plan of action—to get there. She specified exactly what steps had to be completed before any new process was to be implemented or tool deployed. Then she used time offsets (remember the breakfast factory) to determine when each step needed to be done in order for her entire plan to be completed on time. Next, she got the manager of the development engineers to agree to her detailed schedule. She negotiated with him what she had to do and what they had to do—and by what date—in order to meet what became the mutually agreed-upon goals. Finally, to ensure that she stayed on track, she decided to monitor all of her “vendors” on a weekly basis. She would also publish their performance against the schedule to motivate them to meet key dates (an indicator) and to tell her about potential problems (a window in the black box).Read more at location 1829

It is the next year—and only the next year. We will have another chance to replan the second of the five years in the next year’s long-range planning meeting, when that year will become the first year of the five. So, keep in mind that you implement only that portion of a plan that lies within the time window between now and the next time you go through the exercise.Read more at location 1848

A successful MBO system needs only to answer two questions: 1.  Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2.  How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results.)Read more at location 1866   

For the feedback to be effective, it must be received very soon after the activity it is measuring occurs. Accordingly, an MBO system should set objectives for a relatively short period. For example, if we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding MBO system’s time frame should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps even monthly.Read more at location 1875   

The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say “no”—in this case, to too many objectives. We must realize—and act on the realization—that if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say “yes” to and what we say “no” to—which is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.Read more at location 1878

a manager’s output is the output of the organizations under his supervision or influence. We now discover that management is not just a team game, it is a game in which we have to fashion a team of teams, where the various individual teams exist in some suitable and mutually supportive relationship with each other.Read more at location 1973   

The desire to give the individual branch manager the power to respond to local conditions moves us toward a mission-oriented organization. But a similarly legitimate desire to take advantage of the obvious economies of scale and to increase the leverage of the expertise we have in each operational area across the entire corporation would push us toward a functional organization.Read more at location 1995   

Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, “Good management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.” Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.Read more at location 1999

Here I would like to propose Grove’s Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.Read more at location 2054

Why are they an exception to our rule? Because they do not have a common business purpose.Read more at location 2069   

Of course, each hybrid organization is unique because a limitless number of points lie between the hypothetical extremes of the totally functional and the totally mission-oriented forms. In fact, a single organization may very well shift back and forth between the two poles, movement that should be brought on by pragmatic considerations.Read more at location 2071   

But the most important consideration should be this: the shift back and forth between the two types of organizations can and should be initiated to match the operational styles and aptitudes of the managers running the individual units.Read more at location 2076   

In Hungary I was an amateur photographer. During the winter, when I needed high-contrast film, none was to be found anywhere. Yet during the summer, everyone was up to his waist in the stuff, even though regular film was in short supply. Year after year, decision-making in the central planning organization was so clumsy that it could not even respond to totally predictable changes in demand.Read more at location 2084   

For middle managers to succeed at this high-leverage task, two things are necessary. First, they must accept the inevitability of the hybrid organizational form if they are to serve its workings. Second, they must develop and master the practice through which a hybrid organization can be managed. This is dual reporting, the subject of our next chapter.Read more at location 2092   

Matrix management is a complicated affair. Books have been written about it and entire courses of instruction devoted to it.

After we wrestled with the dilemma for a while, it occurred to us that perhaps security personnel should report jointly to the corporate security manager and to the local plant manager.

“A person has to have a boss, so who is in charge here?” Could an employee in fact have two bosses? The answer was a tentative “yes,” and the culture of joint reporting relationships, dual reporting, was born. It was a slow, laborious birth.Read more at location 2119

This system makes a manager’s life ambiguous, and most people don’t like ambiguity. Nevertheless, the system is needed to make hybrid organizations work, and while people will strive to find something simpler, the reality is that it doesn’t exist. A strictly functional organization, which is clear conceptually, tends to remove engineering and manufacturing (or the equivalent groups in your firm) from the marketplace, leaving them with no idea of what the customers want. A highly mission-oriented organization, in turn, may have definite crisp reporting relationships and clear and unambiguous objectives at all times. However, the fragmented state of affairs that results causes inefficiency and poor overall performance.Read more at location 2158   

It’s not because Intel loved ambiguity that we became a hybrid organization. We have tried everything else, and while other models may have been less ambiguous, they simply didn’t work. Hybrid organizations and the accompanying dual reporting principle, like a democracy, are not great in and of themselves. They just happen to be the best way for any business to be organized.Read more at location 2163   

To make hybrid organizations work, you need a way to coordinate the mission-oriented units and the functional groups so that the resources of the latter are allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former.Read more at location 2167

The divisional marketing managers should control most of their own advertising messages. But a coordinating body of peers consisting of the various divisional marketing managers and perhaps chaired by the corporate merchandising manager should provide the necessary functional supervision for all involved.Read more at location 2189   

Dual reporting can certainly tax the patience of the marketing managers, as they are now also required to understand the needs and thought processes of their peers. But no real alternative exists when you need to communicate individual product and market messages and maintain a corporate identity at the same time.Read more at location 2194   

Whenever a person becomes involved in coordination—something not part of his regular daily work—we encounter a subtle variation of dual reporting.Read more at location 2211   

Cindy’s two responsibilities won’t fit on a single organization chart. Instead, we have to think of the coordinating group as existing on a different chart, or on a different plane. This sounds complicated but really isn’t. If Cindy belonged to a church, she would be regarded a member of that organization as well as being part of Intel. Her supervisor there, as it were, would be the local pastor, who in turn is a member of the church hierarchy. No one would confuse these two roles: clearly operating on different planes, each has its own hierarchies, and that Cindy is a member of both groups at the same time would hardly trouble anyone. Cindy’s being part of a coordinating group is like her church membership.Read more at location 2229   

Our ability to use Cindy’s skill and know-how in two different capacities makes it possible for her to exert a much larger leverage at Intel. In her main job, her knowledge affects the work that takes place in one plant; in her second, through what she does in the process coordinating group, she can influence the work of all plants. So we see that the existence of such groups is a way for managers, especially know-how managers, to increase their leverage.Read more at location 2234   

The two-plane concept is a part of everyday organizational life. For instance, while people mostly work at an operating task, they also plan. The hierarchy of the corporation’s planning bodies lies on a plane separate from the one on which you’ll find the operating groups. Moreover, if a person can operate in two planes, he can operate in three.Read more at location 2237   

It could also turn out that people who are in a subordinate/supervisory relationship in one plane might find the relationship reversed in another. For example, I am president of Intel, but in another plane I am a member of a strategic planning group, where I report to its chairman, who is one of our division controllers. It’s as if I were a member of the Army Reserve, and on our weekend exercises I found myself under the command of a regimental leader who happens to be this division controller. Back at the operating ranch, I may be his supervisor or his supervisor’s supervisor, but in the Army Reserve he is my commanding officer.Read more at location 2243   

Many of the groups that we are talking about here are temporary.

In the electronics business, we can’t possibly shift formal organization fast enough to keep up with the pace of advancing technology.Read more at location 2254   

The techniques that we have to master to make hybrid organizations work—dual or multiple reporting and also decision-making by peer groups—are both necessary if such transitory teams are to work. The key factor common to all is the use of cultural values as a mode of control, which we will consider next.Read more at location 2255   

Now you have the tires on your car and you drive off. After a while, you come to a red light. You stop. Do you think about it? No. It’s a law established by the society at large that everybody stops at a red light and you unquestioningly accept and live by it. Vehicular chaos would reign if all drivers had not entered into a contract to stop. The traffic cop monitors adherence and penalizes those who break the law.Read more at location 2266   

Similarly, our behavior in a work environment can be controlled by three invisible and pervasive means. These are: •  free-market forces •  contractual obligations •  cultural valuesRead more at location 2273   

When you bought your tires, your actions were governed by free-market forces, which are based on price:Read more at location 2277   

So you say to the engineers, “Okay, I’ll retain your services for a year for a set amount of money, and you will agree to do a certain type of work in return. We’ve now entered into a contract. I’ll give you an office and a terminal, and you promise me to do the best you can to perform your task.”Read more at location 2292   

So you must give to me as part of the contract the right to monitor and evaluate and, if necessary, correct your work. We agree on other guidelines and work out rules that we will both obey.Read more at location 2296   

In return for stopping at a red light, we count on other drivers to do the same thing, and we can drive through green lights. But for lawbreakers we need policemen, and with them, as with supervisors, we introduce overhead.Read more at location 2298   

Take the tax system. We surrender the right to some of what we earn and expect certain services in return. Giant overhead is necessary to monitor and audit our tax returns.Read more at location 2301   

When the environment changes more rapidly than one can change rules, or when a set of circumstances is so ambiguous and unclear that a contract between the parties that attempted to cover all possibilities would be prohibitively complicated, we need another mode of control, which is based on cultural values. Its most important characteristic is that the interest of the larger group to which an individual belongs takes precedence over the interest of the individual himself.Read more at location 2308   

As for cultural values, management has to develop and nurture the common set of values, objectives, and methods essential for the existence of trust.Read more at location 2318   

Accordingly, given a certain set of conditions, there is always a most appropriate mode of control, which we as managers should find and use.Read more at location 2325   

How do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person’s motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which he works.Read more at location 2326   

Read more at location 2335   

As individual motivation moves toward group interest, the contractual mode becomes appropriate, which governed our stopping for a red light. When group-interest orientation and the CUA factor are both high, the cultural values mode becomes the best choice, which explains to us why we tried to help at the scene of the accident. And finally, when the CUA factor is high and individual motivation is based on self-interest, no mode of control will work well. This situation, like every man for himself on a sinking ship, can only produce chaos.Read more at location 2342   

All we can do is cross our fingers and hope she quickly forgets self-interest and just as quickly gets on top of her job to reduce her CUA factor. Short of that, she’s probably out of luck.Read more at location 2359   

Put another way, this means that management is a team activity. But no matter how well a team is put together, no matter how well it is directed, the team will perform only as well as the individuals on it. In other words, everything we’ve considered so far is useless unless the members of our team will continually try to offer the best they can do.Read more at location 2393

For Maslow, motivation is closely tied to the idea of needs, which cause people to have drives, which in turn result in motivation.Read more at location 2424   

A need once satisfied stops being a need and therefore stops being a source of motivation. Simply put, if we are to create and maintain a high degree of motivation, we must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times.Read more at location 2426   

Maslow defined a set of needs that tend to lie in a hierarchy: when a lower need is satisfied, one higher is likely to take over.Read more at location 2433

you are an aspiring high school athlete and one of the top players passes you in the hall and says hello, you’ll feel terrific.

A friend of mine was thrust into a premature “mid-life crisis” when, in recognition of the excellent work he had been doing, he was named a vice president of the corporation.

For Maslow, self-actualization stems from a personal realization that “what I can be, I must be.”Read more at location 2483   

Once someone’s source of motivation is self-actualization, his drive to perform has no limit.Read more at location 2485   

Two inner forces can drive a person to use all of his capabilities. He can be competence-driven or achievement-driven. The former concerns itself with job or task mastery. A virtuoso violinist who continues to practice day after day is obviously moved by something other than a need for esteem and recognition. He works to sharpen his own skill, trying to do a little bit better this time than the time before, just as a teenager on a skateboard practices the same trick over and over again. The same teenager may not sit still for ten minutes to do homework, but on a skateboard he is relentless, driven by the self-actualization need, a need to get better that has no limit.Read more at location 2487   

Researchers classified the three types of behavior. The first group, termed gamblers, took high risks but exerted no influence on the outcome of events. The second group, termed conservatives, were people who took very little risk. The third group, termed achievers, had to test the limits of what they could do, and with no prompting demonstrated the point of the experiment: namely, that some people simply must test themselves. By challenging themselves, these people were likely to miss a peg several times, but when they began to ring the peg consistently, they gained satisfaction and a sense of achievement. The point is that both competence- and achievement-oriented people spontaneously try to test the outer limits of their abilities.Read more at location 2498   

When the need to stretch is not spontaneous, management needs to create an environment to foster it.Read more at location 2503   

In an MBO system, for example, objectives should be set at a point high enough so that even if the individual (or organization) pushes himself hard, he will still only have a fifty-fifty chance of making them. Output will tend to be greater when everybody strives for a level of achievement beyond his immediate grasp, even though trying means failure half the time. Such goal-setting is extremely important if what you want is peak performance from yourself and your subordinates.Read more at location 2504   

Moreover, if we want to cultivate achievement-driven motivation, we need to create an environment that values and emphasizes output. Read more at location 2507   

At the lower levels of the motivation hierarchy, money is obviously important, needed to buy the necessities of life. Once there is enough money to bring a person up to a level he expects of himself, more money will not motivate.Read more at location 2515   

Yet, in the early years of operation, many employees worked just long enough to accumulate some small sum of money and then quit. For them, money’s motivation was clearly limited; having reached a predetermined notion of how much money they wanted, more money and a steady job provided no more motivation. Now consider a venture capitalistRead more at location 2517   

So it appears that at the upper level of the need hierarchy, when one is self-actualized, money in itself is no longer a source of motivation but rather a measure of achievement. Money in the physiological- and security-driven modes only motivates until the need is satisfied, but money as a measure of achievement will motivate without limit.Read more at location 2522   

Thus the second ten million can be just as important to the venture capitalist as the first, since it is not the utilitarian need for the money that drives him but the achievement that it implies, and the need for achievement is boundless.Read more at location 2525   

Once in the self-actualization mode, a person needs measures to gauge his progress and achievement. The most important type of measure is feedback on his performance. For the self-actualized person driven to improve his competence, the feedback mechanism lies within that individual himself. Our virtuoso violinist knows how the music should sound, knows when it is not right, and will strive tirelessly to get it right.Read more at location 2530   

Accordingly, if the possibility for improvement does not exist, the desire to keep practicing vanishes.Read more at location 2533   

What are some of the feedback mechanisms or measures in the workplace? The most appropriate measures tie an employee’s performance to the workings of the organization. If performance indicators and milestones in a management-by-objectives system are linked to the performance of the individual, they will gauge his degree of success and will enhance his progress. An obvious and very important responsibility of a manager is to steer his people away from irrelevant and meaningless rewards, such as office size or decor, and toward relevant and significant ones. The most important form of such task-relevant feedback is the performance review every subordinate should receive from his supervisor. More about this later.Read more at location 2536   

In physiological and security/safety need-dominated motivation, one fears the loss of life or limb or loss of job or liberty. Does fear have a place in the esteem or self-actualized modes? It does, but here it becomes the fear of failure.Read more at location 2543   

In general, in the upper levels of motivation, fear is not something coming from the outside. It is instead fear of not satisfying yourself that causes you to back off. You cannot stay in the self-actualized mode if you’re always worried about failure.Read more at location 2548

What makes him run? He is trying to beat other people or the stopwatch. This is a simple model of self-actualization, wherein people will exert themselves to previously undreamed heights, forcing themselves to run farther or faster, while their efforts fill barrels with sweat. They will do this not for money, but just to beat the distance, the clock, or other people.Read more at location 2558   

Imagine how productive our country would become if managers could endow all work with the characteristics of competitive sports.Read more at location 2565   

That makes the cliché apply: if you can’t beat them, join them—endow work with the characteristics of competitive sports. And the best way to get that spirit into the workplace is to establish some rules of the game and ways for employees to measure themselves. Eliciting peak performance means going up against something or somebody.Read more at location 2570   

For years the performance of the Intel facilities maintenance group, which is responsible for keeping our buildings clean and neat, was mediocre, and no amount of pressure or inducement seemed to do any good. We then initiated a program in which each building’s upkeep was periodically scored by a resident senior manager, dubbed a “building czar.” The score was then compared with those given the other buildings. The condition of all of them dramatically improved almost immediately. Nothing else was done; people did not get more money or other rewards. What they did get was a racetrack, an arena of competition. If your work is facilities maintenance, having your building receive the top score is a powerful source of motivation.Read more at location 2572   

Comparing our work to sports may also teach us how to cope with failure. As noted, one of the big impediments to a fully committed, highly motivated state of mind is preoccupation with failure. Yet we know that in any competitive sport, at least 50 percent of all matches are lost. All participants know that from the outset, and yet rarely do they give up at any stage of a contest.Read more at location 2584   

The role of the manager here is also clear: it is that of the coach. First, an ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of his team, and because of that his players trust him. Second, he is tough on his team. By being critical, he tries to get the best performance his team members can provide. Third, a good coach was likely a good player himself at one time. And having played the game well, he also understands it well. Turning the workplace into a playing field can turn our subordinates into “athletes” dedicated to performing at the limit of their capabilities—the key to making our team consistent winners.Read more at location 2586   

Surprisingly, none of the early intuitive presumptions could be borne out: the hard findings simply would not show that one style of leadership was better than another. It was hard to escape the conclusion that no optimal management style existed.Read more at location 2602   

My own observations bear this out.Read more at location 2604   

The inevitable conclusion is that high output is associated with particular combinations of certain managers and certain groups of workers. This also suggests that a given managerial approach is not equally effective under all conditions.Read more at location 2608   

Some researchers in this field argue that there is a fundamental variable that tells you what the best management style is in a particular situation. That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience. Moreover, all this is very specific to the task at hand, and it is entirely possible for a person or a group of people to have a TRM that is high in one job but low in another.Read more at location 2610   

What happened was that while the personal maturity of the manager obviously did not change, his task-relevant maturity in the new job was extremely low, since its environment, content, and tasks were all new to him. In time he learned to cope, and his TRM gradually increased.Read more at location 2616   

Similarly, a person’s TRM can be very high given a certain level of complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity, but if the pace of the job accelerates or if the job itself abruptly changes, the TRM of that individual will drop.Read more at location 2621   

The conclusion is that varying management styles are needed as task-relevant maturity varies. Specifically, when the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement, in which the manager pays more attention to the subordinate as an individual than to the task at hand. As the TRM becomes even greater, the effective management style changes again. Here the manager’s involvement should be kept to a minimum, and should primarily consist of making sure that the objectives toward which the subordinate is working are mutually agreed upon.Read more at location 2624   

He is, after all, accountable for the output of the people who report to him; then, too, without a shared set of values a supervisor cannot effectively delegate.Read more at location 2663   

As supervisors, we should try to raise the task-relevant maturity of our subordinates as rapidly as possible for obvious pragmatic reasons.Read more at location 2669   

Finally, at the highest levels of TRM, the subordinate’s training is presumably complete, and motivation is likely to come from within, from self-actualization, which is the most powerful source of energy and effort a manager can harness.Read more at location 2672

The fact is that giving such reviews is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback we as supervisors can provide. It is how we assess our subordinates’ level of performance and how we deliver that assessment to them individually. It is also how we allocate the rewards—promotions, dollars, stock options, or whatever we mayRead more at location 2737   

The review is usually dedicated to two things: first, the skill level of the subordinate, to determine what skills are missing and to find ways to remedy that lack; and second, to intensify the subordinate’s motivation in order to get him on a higher performance curve for the same skill level (see the illustration on this page).Read more at location 2744   

Don’t think for a moment that performance reviews should be confined to large organizations. They should be part of managerial practice in organizations of any size and kind, from the insurance agent with two office assistants to administrators in education, government, and nonprofit organizations.Read more at location 2758   

To make an assessment less difficult, a supervisor should clarify in his own mind in advance what it is that he expects from a subordinate and then attempt to judge whether he performed to expectations.Read more at location 2768   

Finally, as you review a manager, should you be judging his performance or the performance of the group under his supervision? You should be doing both. Ultimately what you are after is the performance of the group, but the manager is there to add value in some way. You need to determine what that is. You must ask: Is he doing anything with his group? Is he hiring new people?Read more at location 2806   

was once asked to approve the performance review of a general manager whose supervisor rated him highly for the year. The manager was responsible for a business unit that lost money, missed its revenue forecast month after month, slipped engineering schedules, and in general showed poor output and internal measures over the year. Accordingly, I could not approve the review. Whereupon his supervisor said, “But he is an outstanding general manager. He is knowledgeable and handles himself well. It’s his organization that did not do well, not the manager himself!” This cut no ice with me because the performance rating of a manager cannot be higher than the one we would accord to his organization!Read more at location 2812

Delivering the Assessment There are three L’s to keep in mind when delivering a review: Level, listen, and leave yourself out.Read more at location 2828

The third L is “leave yourself out.” It is very important for you to understand that the performance review is about and for your subordinate. So your own insecurities, anxieties, guilt, or whatever should be kept out of it. At issue are the subordinate’s problems, not the supervisor’s,Read more at location 2854

But things tend to get stuck at the blame-others stage. If your subordinate does have a problem, there’s no way of resolving it if he continues to blame it on others. He has to take the biggest step: namely assuming responsibility. He has to say not only that there is a problem but that it is his problem.Read more at location 2911

It seems that for an achiever the supervisor’s effort goes into determining and justifying the judgment of the superior performance, while giving little attention to how he could do even better.

What about asking your subordinate to evaluate your performance as his supervisor? I think this might be a good idea. But you should make it clear to your subordinate that it’s your job to assess his performance, while his assessment of you has only advisory status. The point is, he is not your leader; you are his. And under no circumstances should you pretend that you and your subordinates are equal during performance reviews.Read more at location 2980   

In my experience, the best thing to do is to give your subordinate the written review sometime before the face-to-face discussion. He can then read the whole thing privately and digest it. He can react or overreact and then look at the “messages” again. By the time the two of you get together, he will be much more prepared, both emotionally and rationally.Read more at location 2994

If the absolute amount of a raise in salary is important, that person is probably motivated by physiological or safety/security needs.
